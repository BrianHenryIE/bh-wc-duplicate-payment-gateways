Normally I talk to you about WordPress and stuff, but I figured that we all need a little levity in our lives right now. So today&#8217;s episode is actually just a series of bloopers and mistakes that I&#8217;ve made while recording. When I was preparing for this podcast, no one mentioned the deep weirdness of standing alone in your closet talking to yourself, nor did they realize just how lost I can get in the surpassingly, lovely lyricism of a lilting line, and then just have no idea what I&#8217;m supposed to be reading in the script that I wrote for myself. So, my dear friends, I hope these bring you a little laugh. And if we&#8217;ve got any luck at all, you may also hear me singing to myself, my computer, or about how terrible my talking just was. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to a bonus briefing. I know I wasn&#8217;t going to sit boop, boop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I messed up the thing where I&#8217;m talking about how I mess up, of course. I&#8217;m going to do it one more time, and you can choose whatever is a reasonable thing there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we had such a lengthy WP Briefing, WordPress, I’m going to just start that over again.

I sound like I don&#8217;t know what my words are. And I said I wrote the words. I said I was all going to go in one go, and I&#8217;m a liar today. Okay, here we go. For realsies!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final first last take. Here we go.

I gave it two titles, and then couldn&#8217;t remember why I gave it those titles. So I&#8217;ll come up with a title before we publish it. But I also have no idea what it is. I&#8217;m going to ask for help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing project since I have too many commas, and I really believed in my comma when I said it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to Gutenberg&#8230; pfft. Open source software like WordPress. I was going to smash that sentence into half a sentence. I was going to say when you know what you&#8217;re workussing on you have a solution which is not my friends of thing. So, I am just going to say the sentence again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was sitting over here wringing my hands for some reason during that entire list. And so if you can hear me wringing my hands, which would be a whole new height of anxiety for anyone, you let me know, and I will rerecord that also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a concept of. Nope, this is a lie. Get a concept of where to get your tickets is the silliest thing. I&#8217;m starting over from the small list of big things. Also, because I got too excited about how big my list is. I am going to get that excited again. But I will try not to shout about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Humming intro song&#8221; Dun dun dun dun dun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry, I had to scroll up, and I try not to scroll up when I&#8217;m talking in case maybe my whole computer turns into a microphone. Sorry, I&#8217;m just going to keep going because this has been a fine take so far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mercy! I have words that I can say with my mouth. They aren&#8217;t these words today. It seems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build up to&#8230; Oh my goodness. My stomach grumbled, and this microphone, I know,&nbsp; picked it up. And so I&#8217;m going to redo bullet two so that we don&#8217;t just have a small monster under the bed in the middle of the podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, like DEI, I feel s—Eh &#8211; maybe I should say, DEI, somewhere in there, so it&#8217;s clear for people cause I&#8217;m talking to people and not actually a screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I joined the WordPress project, the majority of my work with accessibility was in the context of the digital divide. Now, when talking about the digital divide, there are three concepts around quote-unquote, getting things to people. And those concepts are&#8230; I guess I could say the thing, hold on one second, I can do it. I feel like I&#8217;m chopping up my words like I&#8217;m not really breathing very well. So I apologize. But here we go again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t include that one. Sorry, I&#8217;m so nervous about this episode that, like, my mouth is getting dry, and I worry that you can hear it, and it drives me nuts every time I hear podcasters with a dry mouth, and you can just like hear it clicking and always stresses me out. I&#8217;m like, someone should give that poor thing a drink of water. And I just know I&#8217;m going to feel that way about myself later. And so I&#8217;m trying to stay hydrated, but it also means that I have to stop every two paragraphs and take a drink of water. I apologize for that interlude. I am about to start again, at my next section, which is like, halfway through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I learned that you can hear me swallowing my water with this microphone because it is a spectacular microphone. And so, I apologize for that as well. All right. Here I go. I&#8217;m going to do it all in one take. Watch me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have questions, especially about how to move everything forward. Mm-hmm. Whoops. I put especially in the wrong spot. But I also thought&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Ta da, we did it. Gosh, that&#8217;s a short one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did it. Where&#8217;s my where&#8217;s my turning offing button.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tada!

Here’s what I can create in the classic widgets editor (above) versus what I can create in the new block-based widget editor (below).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/classic-widgets.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/block-widgets-1.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Intersperse Widgets and Custom Code Throughout Your Visual Designs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Container blocks like Cover and Columns make it easy to weave dynamic or interactive elements into your designs. While this is a given for many widgets, the block versions of widgets can be easily wrapped and layered within container blocks to integrate them into your layout more fully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the example below, I tried placing a Search block in front of a Cover block, which creates a nice layered effect. I also inserted Custom HTML blocks within a Columns block to display different messaging depending on the time of day. (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31242051/show-content-based-on-time-of-day-timing-changes-on-different-days-of-the-week\">jQuery script</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/custom-html-1.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use Traditional Widget Layouts (Or Not) With Lots of Flexibility Over Title and Structure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Classic widgets have always had a lockup that includes a widget title. One cool thing about having blocks in widget areas is that you have complete flexibility over how titles appear. For example, you might choose to have a title over every widget, you might only want one title at the top of each widget area, or your design might not need titles at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: Some themes, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/\">Twenty Twenty-One</a>, are designed to flow content horizontally within widget areas.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[musical interlude]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 0:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second of my big scary topics for this month. I&#8217;ll be talking about accessibility, which much like Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DEI in the last episode, is one of those areas where the work is never finished. Also, like DEI in last episode, I feel strongly about accessibility and the need for accessible experiences in the world, but I&#8217;m aware that this is an area where I&#8217;m still learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 1:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has both an accessibility statement and team, which makes a lot of sense given that the software supports so many different people, and industries, and cultures. But if you&#8217;re not quite bought into the idea that software should be accessible, or that accessible software can&#8217;t also be usable, then this is the episode for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 1:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I joined the WordPress project, the majority of my work with accessibility was in the context of the digital divide. Now, when talking about the digital divide, there are three concepts around quote-unquote, &#8220;getting things to people,&#8221; and those are access, usability, and accessibility. Sometimes these words seem interchangeable, but ultimately they have nuanced differences that address different problems. And I like to think of them this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access is making sure that someone can obtain something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usability is making sure that the user experience is understandable or coherent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And accessibility is making sure that it&#8217;s usable by the largest number of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always considered each as a subset of the one that came before it. So having something everyone can access is good, but easy to access and easy to use is better. Easy to use is good, but easy to use and easily accessible is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 2:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After joining WordPress, I discovered that accessibility in the context of software building is well, substantially more complicated. There&#8217;s no such thing as perfect accessibility, or a site that is 100% accessible, and many aspects are pretty open to interpretation. It turns out that accessibility, like so many things in WordPress, is a complicated intersection of art and science.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, there&#8217;s a rule that says, &#8220;Ensure that links are recognizable as links.&#8221; A fast shorthand to accomplish that, that we see all over the internet, is to underline all links or put that icon next to it that says, &#8220;This opens in a new tab.&#8221; You know that icon that&#8217;s a box with an arrow? That definitely has a name, that I definitely don&#8217;t know? That icon. [laughing] But those solutions don&#8217;t necessarily fit every context that you&#8217;ll find a link in, and that&#8217;s where we see that intersection between the art of communication and the science of necessity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 3:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you came with me earlier on the idea that accessibility is a subset of usability, and it&#8217;s not a far leap to say that the choices around accessibility implementations should always include design and the overall user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that some of you are thinking, &#8220;But we have guidelines! Like, that&#8217;s why we have the guidelines, so that not everything has to be a gray area.&#8221; And on the one hand, yeah, that&#8217;s true. There are a lot of guidelines. There are guidelines for the code, and what the code produces, and the design elements. But I worry that when a solution is driven solely by rules, rather than reasons, we run the risk of throwing out the good along with the bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 4:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility has been a consistent topic of debate in the project for as long as I can remember, and based on all of this, it&#8217;s really clear why. There are a few big picture questions that still deserve some sort of canonical answer for WordPress, and where possible I dig in and research the positions that everyone has taken in the past. But I also have questions about how to move everything forward, especially as the editing experience gets more and more standardized across the software, which reduces cognitive load, shortens the learning curve, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the future possibility for having a series of more niche admin interface options?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would it be like to be able to account for functional limitations in a way that lets site builders select what is needed for their clients or organization, or just individual situations they know their sites would be maintained under?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What more could we do if part of the setup flow of WordPress was to select some bundle of potential add ons for neuro diversity, or colorblindness, or dyslexia, and more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a really big question I have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 5:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have to be really transparent here and share that my foundational understanding of accessibility and usability is 10 plus years old, and I learned it in the context of people in education, not software. So a lot of my questions about the future of accessibility and WordPress is the result of old knowledge exploring new spaces, which means they are a little untested. And I&#8217;m so grateful for the contributors who point out what the current research and thinking is, in this incredibly complex field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 6:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I normally like to wrap up the briefing with a tidy takeaway, but this particular topic doesn&#8217;t really lend itself to that. So I&#8217;ll leave you with this. I really believe in WordPress&#8217; mission to democratize publishing. And I, for one, will never stop learning about what gives people more access to the software, and what makes the software more usable, and especially how we can combine usability with accessibility in a way that puts form and function on a level playing field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[musical interlude]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 6:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, that brings us to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thing one, it&#8217;s that time of year where many of our community members take a short break to relax and refresh. I&#8217;ll be taking a bit of a break during the month of August, and so the WP Briefing will return again starting in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thing two, huge thanks to the production crew that helps me make this podcast every couple of weeks, but a special shout out to our editor Dustin Hartzler, who makes quick work of all of my rambling thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 7:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[contemporary outro music]</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11096\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"Configuring Theme Design with theme.json\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/configuring-theme-design-with-theme-json/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 22:26:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11060\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:368:\"Starting in WordPress 5.8, a new tool — “theme.json” — is available to use in your theme.

Maybe you’re hearing about it for the first time, or maybe you’re testing and developing themes with it already. Either way, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here because it&#8217;s an exciting time for WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post provides a quick introduction to this new framework, and describes what’s possible by sharing a few practical tips and examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s theme.json?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, theme.json is just a file that lives at the top-level of a theme’s directory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conceptually, it’s a major shift in how themes can be developed. Theme authors now have a centralized mechanism to tailor the WordPress experience for site authors and visitors. Theme.json provides theme authors fine-grained control over global styles, block styles, and the block editor settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By providing these settings and controls in a single file, theme.json provides a powerful framework that brings together many aspects of theme design and development. And as the block editor matures and adds more features, theme.json will shine as the backbone for themes and the editor to work <em>together</em> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4aa.png\" alt=\"💪\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Use it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the future! But if you’re like me, you might need something more tangible to be convinced. Here are a few reasons why you might use theme.json today:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Control editor settings like color, typography, spacing, and layout, and consolidate where these settings are managed.</li><li>Guarantee that styles apply correctly to blocks and elements across your site.</li><li>Reduce the amount of boilerplate CSS a theme used to provide. Theme.json won&#8217;t replace your stylesheet completely — there will be instances where CSS is needed to give your theme that extra flare (transitions, animations, etc.). But it can greatly reduce the base CSS needed from the theme.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I use it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of this post demonstrates a few theme.json configurations you can try out. The examples use the tt1-blocks<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/blob/master/tt1-blocks/theme.json\"> theme.json</a> — <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">the block-based version of this year’s default theme</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re starting with an existing theme, you might try copying a theme.json from the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/\">WordPress/theme-experiments repository</a> (for example, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/blob/master/fse-tutorial/theme.json\">the fse-tutorial theme</a> by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/poena/\">@poena</a>) and adding it to the root of your theme’s directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Change the typography settings of your site globally</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript;

Now you can add blocks both in widget areas across your site and with live preview through the Customizer. This opens up new possibilities to create content: from no-code mini layouts to the vast library of core and third-party blocks. For our developers, you can find more details in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/block-based-widgets-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/\">Widgets dev note</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Display Posts with New Blocks and Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Query Loop Block makes it possible to display posts based on specified parameters; like a PHP loop without the code. Easily display posts from a specific category, to do things like create a portfolio or a page full of your favorite recipes. Think of it as a more complex and powerful Latest Posts Block! Plus, pattern suggestions make it easier than ever to create a list of posts with the design you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Edit the Templates Around Posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the familiar block editor to edit templates that hold your content—simply activate a block theme or a theme that has opted in for this feature. Switch from editing your posts to editing your pages and back again, all while using a familiar block editor. There are more than 20 new blocks available within compatible themes. Read more about this feature and how to experiment with it in the release notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Three Workflow Helpers</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"496\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=632%2C496&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10988\" data-full-url=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png\" data-link=\"https://wordpress.org/news/?attachment_id=10988\" class=\"wp-image-10988\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=1024%2C803&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=300%2C235&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=768%2C602&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=632%2C343&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10989\" data-full-url=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png\" data-link=\"https://wordpress.org/news/?attachment_id=10989\" class=\"wp-image-10989\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=1024%2C555&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=768%2C416&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"517\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=632%2C517&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10990\" data-full-url=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png\" data-link=\"https://wordpress.org/news/?attachment_id=10990\" class=\"wp-image-10990\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=1024%2C837&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=768%2C628&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Overview of the Page Structure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you need a simple landing page, but sometimes you need something a little more robust. As blocks increase, patterns emerge, and content creation gets easier, new solutions are needed to make complex content easy to navigate. List View is the best way to jump between layers of content and nested blocks. Since the List View gives you an overview of all the blocks in your content, you can now navigate quickly to the precise block you need. Ready to focus completely on your content? Toggle it on or off to suit your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Suggested Patterns for Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in this release the Pattern Transformations tool will suggest block patterns based on the block you are using. Right now, you can give it a try in the Query Block and Social Icon Block. As more patterns are added, you will be able to get inspiration for how to style your site without ever leaving the editor!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style and Colorize Images</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorize your image and cover blocks with duotone filters! Duotone can add a pop of color to your designs and style your images (or videos in the cover block) to integrate well with your themes. You can think of the duotone effect as a black and white filter, but instead of the shadows being black and the highlights being white, you pick your own colors for the shadows and highlights. There’s more to learn about how it works in the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">For Developers to Explore</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=632%2C378&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10992\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=1024%2C613&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=768%2C459&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=1536%2C919&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=2048%2C1225&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Theme.json</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing the Global Styles and Global Settings APIs: control the editor settings, available customization tools, and style blocks using a theme.json file in the active theme.

to all of the community volunteers who contribute in the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forums</a>. They answer questions from people across the world, whether they are using WordPress for the first time, or they’ve been around since the first release all the way back in 2003. These releases are as successful as they are because of their efforts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, thanks to all the community translators who help make WordPress available in over 200 languages for every release. 80 languages have translated 80% or more WordPress 5.8 and our community translators are hard at work ensuring more languages are on their way. If contributing to WordPress appeals to you, it’s easy to learn more.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And before we get started, I have to be honest with you all, this episode and the next one have made me feel really anxious. This one is about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in open source, and especially in WordPress. And the next one is about accessibility in WordPress. And I feel like there&#8217;s just so much to do, and we don&#8217;t do enough, but we do what we can. And still, we will never be done with that work. And if you don&#8217;t know what I mean by Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, you can kind of think of it this way. Diversity is bringing in people with different viewpoints and lived experiences. Equity is making sure everyone has what they need to get a fair chance of success, which is different from equality. And Inclusion is making sure that the environment is built to not only tolerate diverse groups but to celebrate them as well. So remember this as you listen to what I have to say here. We are never where we want to be in either of those spaces. But that shouldn&#8217;t stop us from looking at the things we have done to get us in the right direction. All right. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say a lot that we are a project that serves a majority collection of minority voices. WordPress is global in reach and open source in nature. And you would assume that what allows the software to be used by anyone would also enable it to be built by anyone. After all, your location doesn&#8217;t matter, and who employs you also doesn&#8217;t matter. And your relative social standing certainly shouldn&#8217;t matter. As long as you can communicate with the others contributing to the project, there should be no obstacle to your participation. The mission of the WordPress project is to democratize publishing, right? It&#8217;s to get the ability to have a website tap into passive income on your web presence. I mean, the job is to level the playing field for everyone. However, it&#8217;s my experience that bringing in new voices takes a lot of proactive work on behalf of leaders and contributors. It&#8217;s not enough to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m having a party,&#8221; you also have to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m having a party, and I&#8217;d like you to be there.&#8221; It&#8217;s not enough to think people will make their own space at this table. You have to make sure that you have table settings for everyone. And even beyond the basics of directing people to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on toward the next steps, you have to be honest about the fact that open source contribution requires a fair amount of privilege. By privilege, I mean the luxury of extra time or extra funding or just an understanding employer. WordPress supports 41% of the web. I think it&#8217;s 42% of the web right now. But less than 1% of people who use WordPress show up to help maintain it. And that 1% that does show up skews toward people who already have a pretty high level of representation and technology. And so, when you look at who is building it versus who is using it, it doesn&#8217;t always match. And since what we build so frequently reflects who we are, sometimes what we build doesn&#8217;t match the needs of the people who are using what we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what has WordPress done to be proactive on the question of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion? There are quite a few unseen things that have gone into this over the years and a few pretty visible things. This is a very long list. And it has a whole lot of just reference material. And so the show notes today will come in handy for people, and there will be just a laundry list of linked resources for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first thing that WordPress has done is that we have accepted the burden of proof. I&#8217;m going to share a post about this in the show notes. That means we accept that it&#8217;s not the job of underrepresented folks to figure out if they are welcome. It&#8217;s up to us to make it clear that they are. So, there are three big little things that the community has done over the years. One is that many teams open their text-based meetings with an explanation of what is done in the meeting, who comes to the meetings, where to find help if you&#8217;re lost in the meeting, and for teams that have a specific type of requests that comes into those channels that aren&#8217;t handled in those channels. They also will share where people can go to get those requests taken care of. Many teams have also updated their team handbooks to have good beginner docs, limited use of inside jokes or jargon, and good first bugs. And also, there is a code of conduct in the community declaring that everyone is welcome and clarifies what to do if you see folks being unwelcoming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second big thing that folks in the WordPress community have done is written down what was unwritten. Having things clearly documented unlocks institutional knowledge that you&#8217;d otherwise have to know someone to get. Clarity and process and the structure help anyone engage with your organization, not just the people who have extra time to figure things out. What that looks like in the WordPress project is that many teams have documented their workflows and their working spaces and just their general team norms. Many teams have also started defining what it means to be a team rep and holding open processes to choose those team reps. Many other community leaders and I have written down countless unspoken rules, guidelines, and philosophical underpinnings so that people don&#8217;t have to guess what we&#8217;re doing or why we&#8217;re doing things, or where we want to do them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the more visible thing that the WordPress project has been doing is that we found ways to invite people in, and they&#8217;re not failsafe; they’re not foolproof, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. The first one is an ongoing, diverse speaker training initiative. And I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes as well. It is run by Jill Binder and a fantastic group of contributors that collaborate with her. And I really have loved watching that particular program grow and flourish and help WordPress make a difference where we absolutely can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that was pretty visible about how we invited people in was at the end of 2020, and we had an all-women and nonbinary release squad for our biggest release of the year; WordPress 5.6. I had a group of probably 70 women and nonbinary identifying folx who joined in the process and joined in learning more about the process. Some of them have continued in the project. Others have stepped away for various reasons. But all of them are welcome to return. And I encourage everyone to return to contribution when time and resources make that possible for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that we&#8217;ve done, which I have talked about a lot, is the revival of the testing and triage practices. That has been work that&#8217;s been ongoing for a number of years. And it happens across multiple teams. It is not always immediately clear to people why the testing work. And the triage work is identifiable for me as a way to invite people into this process. And so I&#8217;ll be briefly clear about it right now. So testing as a practice brings in the users that otherwise don&#8217;t have a lot of spare time and that extra privilege to like, figure out what&#8217;s going on with WordPress, and contribute their own fixes to problems. They can give back to this project by being co-developers with us, co-creators with our entire process of making WordPress real and usable for the largest number of people that we can because we now support 42% of the web. And then, the triage practice invites in a diverse voice of people. Because you don&#8217;t necessarily always need to know everything about a project to help with triage. And when you&#8217;re helping with triage, you get active learning through participating in the process. But you also get passive learning from the people who already know huge amounts about the project and the process and everything that goes into it. And so it&#8217;s a low key low stress way to get your feet wet and start building that knowledge that sometimes is hard to come by unless you are actively working in it. So the testing practices, the triage practices, I really to the core of my being believe that those are active and ongoing ways for us to invite people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have a chance to get their voices heard in an open source project. And y&#8217;all, as I said at the start, y’all, there&#8217;s nothing about this list that I just shared, which makes me feel like our work on this is done. Just like any muscle, you don&#8217;t fight to peak fitness, and then hit the big stop button on time and say, &#8220;Now, I never have to work out again.&#8221; If we did, the world would be a very different place probably. But it does then lead us to the next steps for fostering a community culture that&#8217;s as broad as the people who use this software. If you believe in leadership at any level, as I do, there are a ton of things that you can do right now. But I&#8217;ll boil them down into three big chunks of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, check your community area, or whatever community you want to apply this to, for things that need a little more proactive work. I will share a post called<em> Building A Culture of Safety</em> that will take you through a list of good first steps. And it is not as hard as it looks. When you say build a culture of safety, there are many really clear-cut minor changes that you can ask people to make and, in like, four or five different areas that can help your community be more welcoming and more open.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do is know that small changes add up over time and commit to making those changes where you can. If you are elite at any level, you know that supporting people and processes is the responsibility of everyone in the group. And if you can make your own autonomous decisions and commit to making small changes that make a big difference over time, you will be part of that solution. And that is not specific to any one group that we have in our communities. You can be an ally for anyone, whether they look like you, whether they have your same experiences, or not. And sometimes, it&#8217;s as easy as just holding space for the people who haven&#8217;t had a chance to talk yet. And on the subject of holding space and the way that we communicate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing that I think is incredibly important is that you can take on as a foundational personal practice the concept of ethical communication. I&#8217;ll share a post about that as well in the show notes, but the core of it is that you have to know that what you say and don&#8217;t say what you do and don&#8217;t do has an impact on others and embrace that responsibility. All right, so you made it all the way through, and I am so proud of you. I&#8217;m sure you have questions about this. And I encourage you to share those. You can email them to me at wp briefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got two things for you today. First and foremost, WordPress 5.8 gets released tomorrow. It&#8217;s a big release, and lots of people have been working on it. So get your update processes ready and keep an eye on wordpress.org/news for the announcement post. Second, and still pretty important, team reps have been working on their quarterly check-ins so that all other teams can get an idea of what&#8217;s happening around the WordPress office. Keep an eye out for that post on make.wordpress.org/updates. And that is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re talking about one of my favorite parts of the project &#8211; WordPress events. The in-person component of the project is the dark matter that helps us build resilience and thrive as a group. A lot of what I&#8217;m going to share applies to every WordPress event, whether it&#8217;s a meetup or workshop, a contributor day, any other sort of format. But I&#8217;ll be focused on WordCamps. It&#8217;s been a while since we had any in-person WordCamps. Our last two were WordCamp Malaga in Spain and WordCamp Greenville in the US. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped anyone from gathering people together online. Which honestly makes a lot of sense for WordPress. Because there are many reasons we gather, the main three reasons are connecting, inspiring, and contributing. It&#8217;s true. It says so right in our documentation, &#8220;paper rustling.&#8221; All WordPress events should connect WordPress users, inspire people to do more with WordPress, and contribute to the WordPress project. As an aside, I&#8217;ll tell you that some groups also get to collaborate and educate in there, but connect, inspire, contribute. Those are the big three. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about today. And if you subscribe to this podcast for the back office deep cuts, I&#8217;ll also have a few of those for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so first up, connect. WordCamps are generally annual-ish gatherings organized by local WordPress meetup groups. They&#8217;re not meant to be big or fancy. The definition of the minimum viable product for WordCamp is 50 people gathered all day to talk about WordPress. They are intentionally affordable to allow people from all walks of life to attend, meet, share and learn. This is made possible by donations and sponsorships from local businesses and larger businesses in the WordPress ecosystem. And this helps us get people connected to those in their community that works with or are sustained by WordPress. That connection feeds into the overall health of the global WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is inspire. WordCamps do not discriminate. They are open to any WordPress users, developers, designers, or other enthusiasts, regardless of their level of experience. And because of this, sessions generally span a variety of formats. So presentations or live demos to workshops or panels, any other format you can think of. But that also means that there are a variety of skill levels represented. There&#8217;s always content about how to use WordPress. That’s a given. But you can also count on content that inspires people to do more with their own dreams and aspirations. When I was still organizing WordCamps, my favorite thing was seeing people who came back year after year, putting into practice something that they learned the year before. It is that <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> aspect to WordCamps that lets people see the edge of their ideas and then expand that just a little bit further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, contribute. WordCamps often have a contribution component to them. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a talk telling you how you can get more involved in the WordPress project. But sometimes, it&#8217;s a whole contributor day. And those range in size from single focus, like everyone, will show up and learn how to review a theme or a focus from every team that we have, like at the big flagship events where we gather hundreds of people into a room just to contribute to WordPress and all of the teams that go with it. Getting started with contributing can be daunting, but it is also essential to avoid something called the Tragedy of the Commons, an economic concept. So I&#8217;ll share a link to that in the show notes below. But the most important thing, the most important thing to remember, is that WordPress is open source. And we asked people to help us keep this great tool running by giving back a little bit of their time if they have gotten any benefit from the WordPress project or CMS over the course of their careers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. The three big things you can get from a WordCamp. I know that I can&#8217;t wait to get back to them myself because while a lot of these things can still happen online and do, it&#8217;s really hard to replace the dark matter of in-person connections for open source projects. And since we&#8217;re talking dark matter anyway, let&#8217;s dig into it a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of the section, I mentioned that WordCamps are local, locally organized, and people are encouraged to attend locally. But I am part of a group that ends up traveling to a lot of WordCamps. If you don&#8217;t know about the unseen work of WordPress, this raises eyebrows. So here is some clarification around the back office work that some of these traveling WordCampers often do. When I listed these out, there were about 20 different tasks, 20 different jobs, which was, frankly, a bit overwhelming when I listed them that way. So I&#8217;ve grouped them into kind of two genres, each with a group of current versus future types of work. So my two big buckets, big picture stuff, and then community stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big picture stuff, our first big genre here, when you&#8217;re looking at current topics, current issues kind of information, when we&#8217;re working on big picture stuff, you get the clarification of the mission or vision of WordPress, the sharing of open source methods or processes that we use in the WordPress project, and also sometimes those goal-setting conversations that you have to have both because we have a bunch of teams and team reps, that have a lot of really great ideas about what can be done in their teams to help WordPress succeed. But then also, because when you are working, when you&#8217;re contributing to a single team in the project, it can sometimes be hard to know how your work relates to the overall goals and visions of WordPress. And so that&#8217;s part of the work that gets done that I do there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you&#8217;re looking at future topics, future issues, the second part of this genre, that stuff like starting conversations or discussions around what the future holds for WordPress, and that&#8217;s the project as well as the technology or hearing from people about big things coming up for them. And any content that can support it, anything that I can provide to support those big things. It&#8217;s also a good time for me and others to identify trends based on what I see in presentations or what I hear from people at social functions. Really, it&#8217;s just a huge opportunity for information gathering to make sure that I know what everyone else in the project is trying to do and if they understand what the project is trying to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second big genre of things that happen in that dark matter kind of work at WordCamps is what I call community stewardship—so taking care of the community itself for the project itself. And a lot of that work is actually incident response kind of work. So conflict resolution, mediation often happens at in-person events, but also uncovering the shared foundations, the shared understanding for upcoming changes. So a lot of really, in the weeds kind of change management work. And for me, it&#8217;s certainly doing my best as a cultural liaison when I do see that there has been some miscommunication or gathering context for the latest disagreement that people are having with me so that I can clarify anything that was misunderstood from what I said. And also a little bit of policy clarification, just explaining why we do things and the way we do them. So for community stewardship, that&#8217;s kind of the current stuff that we look at. And that I do when I&#8217;m traveling for WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the future tasks that we do with community stewardship in the project, that stuff like training, and that&#8217;s training team reps, community deputies, or new contributors like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not really one type of training, necessarily. But then also, all of the checking in with our organizers, team reps, volunteers, sponsors, everyone like that, to make sure that what we have in the project and what&#8217;s happening in the project, the tools that we have, the experience that contributors have while they are working here, and WordPress is good, and is what they need. We&#8217;ve got a lot of tools to get things done in WordPress, and we can always make them better. And so checking in with people to kind of see how those processes are, how the tools are making sure that I have an idea of where our holes are and what needs to be patched, and how we can patch them in the long run. So that&#8217;s all of the future planning kind of work and topic stuff, just you know, making sure that WordPress has what it needs to survive long into the future and long after I&#8217;m doing anything with it, and long after you&#8217;re doing anything with it either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, lots and lots of unseen work being done at our in-person events. But folks who keep a keen eye on the online global work of WordPress will probably recognize that a lot of that work is also done routinely on make.wordpress.org and within the making WordPress Slack. There’s just, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s just something different about receiving information from a human being with a face rather than an avatar with a photo. So I guess at the end of the day, that means the dark matter that keeps open source together is really an issue of communication. And you&#8217;ll get no arguments for me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And there&#8217;s really just one big thing. And that&#8217;s WordPress 5.8. We are about two weeks away from this big release; the community has been working tirelessly on it. And it&#8217;s shaping up to be one of the most tested releases that we&#8217;ve had in a long time. Myself, I&#8217;m grateful to see so much activity before the release. Since 5.8 and 5.9 releases represent such monumental shifts in our software, I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to see so much activity prior to the release, especially in the beta period. We&#8217;ve been testing everything for it feels like six or eight months, and we&#8217;re really starting to see the positive benefits of that. And I think that we, the WordPress community, should be really proud of everything that we&#8217;re going to ship in 2021. Okay, so that was less of a small list of big things and really like one big thing with a generous garnish of encouragement, but you deserve it. So thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10889\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"The Month in WordPress: June 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 15:11:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10896\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:334:\"Once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:40</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, we hosted WordCamp Europe and had the double pleasure of a demo that showed us a bit about the future of WordPress and an interview that looked back while also looking a bit forward. If you haven&#8217;t seen the demo, it was beautiful. And I&#8217;ve included a link to it in the show notes. And if you haven&#8217;t heard the interview, there were a few specific moments that I&#8217;d like to take the time to delve into a little more. Brian Krogsgard, in his conversation with Matt Mullenweg, brought up three really interesting points. I mean, he brought up a lot of interesting points, but there were three that I would particularly like to look into today. The first was about balance. The second was about cohesion. And the third was about those we leave behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 01:24</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first is this question of balance. Brian brought this up in the context of the overall economic health of the WordPress ecosystem. And in that particular moment, he talked about companies that are coming together, companies that are merging. And in Matt&#8217;s answer, the part that I found the most interesting was when he said, &#8220;the point at which there is the most commercial opportunity is also the point at which there is the most opportunity for short-termism. He went on to talk about the importance of long-term thinking and collective thinking about what makes us, and us here means probably the WordPress project, more vibrant and vital in 10 or 20 or 30 years. One of the things that he specifically called out in that answer was the responsibility of larger companies in the ecosystem. For instance, like Automattic, to commit fully to giving back, there are many ways now that companies can give back to WordPress so that we all replenish the Commons. They can pay for volunteer contributors&#8217; time; they can create and sponsor entire teams through the Five for the Future program. They can contribute time through our outreach program. And they can even contribute to WordPress&#8217;s ability to own our own voice by engaging their audience&#8217;s awareness of what&#8217;s next in WordPress, or whatever. And I know this balance, this particular balance of paid contributors or sponsored contributors, compared to our volunteer contributors or self-sponsored contributors; I know that this balance is one that people keep an eagle eye on. I am consistently on a tight rope to appropriately balanced those voices. But as with so many things where balance is key, keeping an eye on the middle or the long-distance can really help us get it right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 03:23</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second question was one of cohesion and specifically cohesion over the competition. Brian asked how, if people feel disadvantaged, you can foster a feeling of cohesion rather than competition? And Matt&#8217;s first answer was that competition is great. Specifically, he said that competition is great as long as you consider where your collaboration fits into the mission. And he also spent some time exploring how competitors in the ecosystem can still work from a community-first mindset. I personally cannot agree enough about some of the benefits of collaboration alongside your competitors. I remind sponsored contributors from time to time, and I think it&#8217;s true for any contributor that you are an employee of your company first and a contributor to WordPress second. However, once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project. So you get all this subject matter expertise from competitive forces, collaborating in a very us versus the problem way. And when you do that, you&#8217;re always going to find a great solution. It may not be as fast as you want it to build things out in the open in public. And so sometimes we get it wrong and have to come back and fix it but still, given time, we&#8217;re going to come out with the best solution because we have so many skilled people working on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 05:01</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third question that I wanted to really touch on is the question of those we leave behind. Brian asked Matt if he thought mid-sized agencies and mid-sized consultants were being squeezed out with the block editor. Matt&#8217;s high-level answer was no, and I tend to agree with him. It&#8217;s not all mid-sized anything any more than it&#8217;s all small-sized anything. His answer continued to look at what stands to change for users with the block editor and who really can stand to benefit. It made me think back to my WordPress 5.0 listening tour. We launched WordPress 5.0, which was, in case anyone forgets, the first release with the block editor in it. I took a six-month-long tour to anywhere that WordPressers were so I could hear their main worries, what Brian is saying in there, and what Matt is saying to really came up all the time in those conversations. And basically, it was that this update takes all the power away from people who are building websites. And in these conversations, and Matt and Brian&#8217;s conversation, it was really focused on our freelancers and consultants. But at the same time, all of them heard that this update gives power back to all of the people who could build websites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 06:28</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could not shake the feeling at the time. And honestly, I can&#8217;t shake it now that no high-end consultants, or freelancers, or any other developer or site creator sit around just longing for maintenance work. After six months of talking to people, I didn&#8217;t hear anyone say, &#8220;you know, I just love making the same author card over and over and over.&#8221; Or, &#8220;updated the footer every week, this month. And that&#8217;s why I got into this business.&#8221; And more than the feeling that there just wasn&#8217;t anyone who just loved maintenance, I got a feeling that there were real problems that needed to be solved for these clients and that they wanted to solve them. And that they also would gladly trade updating footers for the much more interesting work of creating modern and stylish business hubs based on WordPress for the clients who trust them so much. All of that, I guess, is to say that, yes, the block editor does give power back to our clients again, but not at the expense of those who have to build the sites in the first place. I think it stands to restore everyone&#8217;s sense of agency more than we truly realize. So that&#8217;s my deep dive on WordCamp Europe; I included links to the demo and the talk below, just in case you haven&#8217;t seen them yet. And you want to get a little bit of insight into the full context of the conversations that I just did a bit of a deep dive into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 08:15</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. All right, I have three things for you today. Number one, tomorrow, we package WordPress 5.8 beta three. If you&#8217;ve never had a chance to stop by the core channel in slack for the past packaging process, I really encourage you to stop by; we call them release parties. It&#8217;s a bunch of people who stand around and help get it done. So you can also see how it gets done. And if you&#8217;re feeling brave, you can even try your hand at testing out one of the packages as soon as it&#8217;s ready. The second thing is that a week from tomorrow, we reach our first release candidate milestone. So if you have meant to submit any bugs or patches or if you&#8217;ve been procrastinating on documentation, or dev notes, right now is the time so that we can have a chance to get everything into the release by the time we reach the release candidate milestone on the 29th. And the third thing is that we are currently right in the middle of WordCamp Japan. That is a great opportunity to meet some contributors and maybe even get started with contributions yourself. So stop by if you haven&#8217;t had a chance to check it out already. I will leave a link in the show notes. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

Let&#8217;s start with some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Powerful Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Discover several new blocks and expressive tools, including blocks for&nbsp;<em>Page Lists</em>,&nbsp;<em>Site Title</em>,&nbsp;<em>Logo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tagline</em>. A powerful&nbsp;<em>Query Loop</em>&nbsp;block offers multiple ways for displaying lists of posts and comes with new block patterns that take advantage of its flexibility and creative possibilities.</li><li>Interacting with nested blocks has been made easier with a permanent toolbar button for selecting a parent. Block outlines are shown when hovering or focusing on the different block type buttons. Block handles are now also present for drag and drop when in “select” mode.</li><li>Introduces the&nbsp;<strong>List View</strong>, a panel that can be toggled and helps navigate complex blocks and patterns.</li><li>Reusable blocks have an improved creation flow and support for history revisions. </li><li>A cool new duotone block adds images effects which can be used in media blocks or supported in third-party blocks. Color presets can also be customized by the theme.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Handpicked Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns can now also be recommended and selected during block setup, offering powerful new flows. Pattern transformations are also possible and allow converting a block or a collection of blocks into different patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New collection of Patterns and an initial integration with the upcoming Pattern Directory on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><span style=\"color: initial;, sans-serif\">New template editor that allows creating new custom templates for a page using blocks.</span></li><li>Themes can now control and configure styling with a theme.json file, including layout configuration, block supports, color palettes, and more.</li><li>New design tools and enhancements to existing blocks, including more color, typography, and spacing options, drag and drop for Cover backgrounds, additions to block transformation options, ability to embed PDFs within the File block, and more.</li><li>Includes improvements to how the editor is rendered to more accurately resemble the frontend.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Internet Explorer 11</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Support for Internet Explorer 11 is ending in WordPress this year.

Among other things, one notices the increased activity in the WordPress space and the growing length of all the newsletters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, the core team managed two releases: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/09/01/wordpress-5-8-1-rc-1/\">WordPress 5.8.1 RC</a> with a few bug fixes, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/09/01/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11-4-1-september/\">Gutenberg plugin 11.4</a>. Grzegorz and I discussed details and more in  our <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/changelog-51-new-gallery-block-theme-json/\">51st episode of the Gutenberg Changelog podcast.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gutenberg developer team received reinforcements with the <a href=\"https://frontity.org/blog/frontity-is-joining-automattic/\">Frontity team, who joined Automattic&#8217;s Dotorg Division.</a> WordPress Tavern&#8217;s Sarah Gooding has more details on this story: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-frontity-founders-to-work-full-time-on-gutenberg\">Automattic Acquires Frontity, Founders to Work Full-Time on Gutenberg</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the excitement around new beginnings, we also need to say <a href=\"https://andreamiddleton.blog/2021/08/30/thanks-for-a-great-10-years-wordpress/\">Farewell to Andrea Middleton</a>. Soon, she will leave the WordPress space to enrich the communities on Reddit with her leadership brilliance. I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am without Andrea&#8217;s encouragement, support, and guidance. I will be eternally grateful for all her work in the WordPress community, her big heart and for her friendship. It&#8217;s hard to imagine WordPress without her. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been blown away by all the kind words from so many of you on Twitter, Slack, and email. Thank you all so much! You really made me feel the love. There will be group hugs at in-person events!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that, I leave you to the brilliant minds writing and experimenting with Gutenberg and sharing their lessons learned. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br />Birgit</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">Gutenberg Changelog</a>&nbsp;podcast </strong><br />🎙️&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/620NwVKQJGdTupy36zYxvg?mc_cid=4b6c9f88fe\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9ndXRlbmJlcmd0aW1lcy5jb20vZmVlZC9wb2RjYXN0\">Google</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gutenberg-changelog/id1469294475\">iTunes</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pca.st/podcast/f8445ec0-7508-0137-f267-1d245fc5f9cf\">PocketCasts</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/show/gutenberg-changelog\">Stitcher</a>&nbsp;|<br />🎙️&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/chi7j-9904a/Gutenberg-Changelog-Podcast\">Pod Bean</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://castbox.fm/channel/Gutenberg-Changelog-id2173375\">CastBox</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/gutenberg-changelog-878239/\">Podchaser</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/podcast\">RSS Feed</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress 5.9 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> publish the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/09/03/wordpress-5-9-planning-roundup/\">WordPress 5.9 Planning Roundup</a> outlining the schedule and scope of the last WordPress release for 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go/NoGo Decision will be made on or around October 12, 2012, followed by the Feature Freeze / Bug Fixes deadline of November 9th. A week later, on November 16, Beta 1 would be released. Between Beta 1 and the final release date are roughly four weeks. The final release is set for December 14th, 2021</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scope matches pretty much what <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/13/preliminary-road-to-5-9/\">Matias Ventura onlined in his &#8220;Road to 5.9</a>&#8221; plus a new default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy also mentioned some roadmap hopefuls, mostly PHP related; among them the Pattern insertion and creation for submission to the directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She ended the post with a call for volunteer for Triage Lead and Release Coordinators, positions that need to be covered to get a release started.

As early adopter, she wrote: &#8220;Converting <a href=\"https://wpaino.com/\">Aino </a>to a block theme was our first big step towards this new WordPress theme era.

Interchangeable in&nbsp;function, while remaining distinct in&nbsp;style.&#8221; </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Gardner</strong> followed along and shared how he implemented <a href=\"https://frostwp.com/theme-json-font-sizes/\"><strong>Theme.json and Standardizing Font Sizes</strong></a> for the Frost Theme</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tammie Lister</strong> also makes the case for <a href=\"https://ephemeralthemes.com/2021/08/31/the-need-for-standardisation/\"><strong>The need for standardization</strong></a>, by writing about the human aspect, mostly cognitive load and the spark of creativity that comes from limits. Another aspect Lister touches upon is translation, and the many languages, WordPress is translated into. She has a great way explaining the unlimited possibilities, starting with three main colors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest argument for basic standardization Lister makes almost as a side note, is the interchangeability of Themes. What happens to all the user choices for color, typography etc., when the site owner switches the Theme? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is quite timely as a question.

Anyone is welcome to run, walk, bike, or swim the 5K any time between October 1-31. The requirements are fairly loose in that you can use any exercise app to track your run if you want. Participants are also encouraged to share a selfie, a screenshot of your route, and write a blog post that includes the&nbsp;#wwwp5k&nbsp;tag. Automattic will use the hashtag to include pictures on the official race site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the pandemic, much of the social running industry has gone online and virtual races have become more common. Although they don&rsquo;t carry the same energy as in-person races, virtual races help friends keep setting fitness goals and encourage each other through online challenges. Joining in the <a href=\"https://wwwp5k.run/\">Worldwide WordPress 5K</a> is a great way to connect with friends around the world for an offline challenge that benefits your health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is plenty of time to start training to reach a goal ahead of October and lots of resources available for <a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a19995645/5k-training-plan/\">running your first 5K</a>. If all other motivations fail, maybe Wapuu can get you off the couch. The lack of in-person WordCamps has left some people hankering for new WordPress swag, and the 5K wapuu is ready to deliver. Participants can choose from a wide array of official gear, including hoodies, t-shirts, water bottles, tank tops, pins, socks, and more.

Extendify purchased the plugin from its creator, D&#333;vy Paukstys, in November 2020, in a deal that was not highly publicized. It is currently active on more than 1 million WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout most of its history, Redux has been known as a popular options framework for themes and plugins. In 2020, Paukstys <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/redux-framework-relaunches-focuses-efforts-on-gutenberg-templates\">relaunched the framework</a> with a focus on Gutenberg templates. Users can now browse more than 1,000 templates from inside the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is this new template-browsing feature that was found to be vulnerable in Wordfence&rsquo;s recent security report, due to a lax permissions check on the WP REST API endpoints the plugin uses to process requests in its template library. On August 3, 2021, Wordfence disclosed one high-severity vulnerability described as an <em>&ldquo;Incorrect Authorization Leading to Arbitrary Plugin Installation and Post Deletion&rdquo;</em> and a lower-severity <em>&ldquo;Unauthenticated Sensitive Information Disclosure</em>&rdquo; vulnerability to the plugin&rsquo;s owners. The report published this week describes the nature of the threat:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>One vulnerability allowed users with lower permissions, such as contributors, to install and activate arbitrary plugins and delete any post or page via the REST API. A second vulnerability allowed unauthenticated attackers to access potentially sensitive information about a site&rsquo;s configuration.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Extendify responded immediately and shipped a patched version (4.2.13) of the Redux Framework on August 11, 2021. At the time of publishing, more than 71% of sites using the Redux Framework plugin are running on older versions that remain vulnerable. Users are advised to update to the latest version in order to get the security patch, especially now that Wordfence has published an article showing how attackers could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 Sep 2021 03:50:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"WPTavern: A World Where (Some) Block Development Is Merely a Templating System With No Build Process?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=122154\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:241:\"https://wptavern.com/a-world-where-some-block-development-is-merely-a-templating-system-with-no-build-process?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-world-where-some-block-development-is-merely-a-templating-system-with-no-build-process\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6447:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">What if WordPress developers lived in a world where we could create PHP-based templates that would output data on the front end and handle editable fields via the block editor? Or, we had a system where we could create blocks without a build step?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are many reasons the modern WordPress editor is not the best fit for everyone just yet, one stumbling block has been building custom interface components. The ecosystem has a deep history of creating bespoke solutions for clients using PHP. These have been custom meta boxes and form fields in the classic editor screen for the most part. When WordPress 5.0 launched with its block editor, it turned the world upside down, often leaving agencies and freelancers with no way to move forward without dedicating massive resources to learning React to build blocks or interact with the new editing screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The solution?</em> Stick with what you know. It was cheaper and already seemed to do the job well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we talk about the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-classic-editor-support-extended-for-at-least-another-year\">support window for the Classic Editor</a> plugin, the WordPress project needs people to provide tools for this segment of the ecosystem if it ever plans on bringing them along for the ride. Solutions such as ACF Pro and Genesis Custom Blocks have bridged some of the technical gaps. However, the user experience can be sub-par when using server-side rendering in the block editor. That method works well for some types of blocks but not all. We need to take this one step more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark Jaquith, a lead WordPress developer, shared a few questions from Helen Hou-Sand&iacute;, another lead developer, around this idea and a basic concept about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markjaquith/status/1432461667187765251\">what this might look like</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Weekend exploration, egged on and sparked by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenhousandi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@helenhousandi</a>:<br /><br />&ldquo;What if building custom blocks for the Block Editor was as easy as supplying attributes and a block of HTML? What if this produced React editing code and PHP rendering code without a build step?&rdquo; <a href=\"https://t.co/r86Phu88SX\">pic.twitter.com/r86Phu88SX</a></p>&mdash; Mark Jaquith (@markjaquith) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markjaquith/status/1432461667187765251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 30, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Hou-Sand&iacute; followed this with a <a href=\"https://helen.blog/2021/08/exploring-custom-blocks-from-a-php-centric-developer-ux-point-of-view/\">detailed post on the concept</a>, but she pointed out that this is merely an exploratory phase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The React-based WordPress block editor (sometimes referred to as Gutenberg) is a powerful tool for WYSIWYG editing that continues to prove to be somewhere between a speed bump and a roadblock for long-time WordPress developers who historically have been more PHP-centric,&rdquo; she wrote in the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a WordPress developer, there is a not-so-small chance that you are thinking, <em>Yep, I have hit a few of those speed bumps and crashed into that roadblock a few times.</em> This is unlikely news to you. What might start winning hearts and minds is acknowledging and understanding where much of the problem lies for custom development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;By leveraging the familiar parts of PHP-based templating and creating a bridge that demonstrates the power of React when combined with the markup and styling already being done for the front-end, we can de-duplicate code, help demystify the critical role of JavaScript in modernizing WordPress, and serve as an on-ramp for PHP-centric developers to create compelling and delightful 1:1 live preview editing experiences,&rdquo; wrote Hou-Sand&iacute;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This all boils down to the process of, essentially, writing some template code that works on both the front-end and editor without all the complexities of currently setting up and building blocks. That is an exciting prospect, evidenced by the numerous likes, retweets, and replies to Jaquith&rsquo;s tweet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hou-Sand&iacute; pointed out that the current thought process is primarily about easing the transition for custom client block solutions and not necessarily for WordPress itself. However, that does not mean that this or a similar solution might not be a part of the core platform&rsquo;s future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg project lead Mat&iacute;as Ventura <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matias_ventura/status/1432648540501729281\">replied to Ben Gillbanks</a> in the same Twitter thread that it was definitely something they were considering. &ldquo;From a core perspective we had to ensure the primitives and interactivity is not compromised, but there&rsquo;s no reason why that should imply a full JS toolchain for simpler blocks. Lowering barrier of entry is important.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like several others, Gillbanks thought that such a system would have made an easier transition for PHP-centric developers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BinaryMoon/status/1432623688503922690\">from the start</a>. However, the project was not ready for that at the time, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matias_ventura/status/1432638250422833153\">according to Ventura</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tricky to do something like this from the start until the compile target APIs are robust enough,&rdquo; he tweeted. &ldquo;We are getting to a point where many of the interactive properties are clustered into primitives and components, which makes a templating approach more appealing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic developer Riad Benguella shared a similar solution in the past week, launching the <a href=\"https://github.com/youknowriad/blocky\">Blocky project</a> on GitHub. With his approach, developers utilize the <code>block.json</code> file to create the template or view component and run it through a simple build step to generate the block&rsquo;s code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is not too early to hope and dream, it may just be a bit premature to begin seriously considering whether such tools will land in core WordPress. However, seeing some of the lead WordPress and Gutenberg developers at least openly talking about solutions is something worth paying attention to.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 Sep 2021 01:37:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 11.4 Overhauls Galleries, Adds Axial Padding for Buttons, and Lays Groundwork for Global Spacing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=122156\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:273:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-4-overhauls-galleries-adds-axial-padding-for-buttons-and-lays-groundwork-for-global-spacing?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-11-4-overhauls-galleries-adds-axial-padding-for-buttons-and-lays-groundwork-for-global-spacing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6285:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Another two weeks have flown by, and another <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/09/01/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11-4-1-september/\">Gutenberg plugin update</a> is in the books. I always look forward to the latest release, awaiting what goodies our contributor community has produced. Sometimes I jump the gun and install a development version of the plugin to understand an upcoming feature, such as the new &ldquo;block gap&rdquo; style setting. Other times, I like to be surprised with enhancements like the new vertical/horizontal padding controls for the Button block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there is always a good chance that a plugin update will throw off our theme&rsquo;s editor styles in a new and exciting way. It feels like it has been a while since Gutenberg caught me off guard. At least it is <em>only</em> the post title this go-round. The WP Tavern theme is aging a bit anyway. It is due for an update (<em>hint, hint</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from block gap and axial padding, Gutenberg 11.4 turns the Gallery block into a container for nested Image blocks and adds duotone filter support to featured images. Other notable enhancements include an option for adding alt text to the Cover block and font-weight support to the Post Date, Post Terms, and Site Tagline blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Axial Padding for Button Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adjusting vertical and horizontal Button padding.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Button block now supports changing the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33859\">spacing along the X or Y axis</a> when unlinking the padding. Previously, users could define the padding for all sides, but this could be tedious work. In most designs, top and bottom (vertical) padding should match, and left and right (horizontal) should get the same treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change should speed up padding customization in nearly all cases. However, it does introduce a regression. The consensus in the ticket was that the tradeoff for a less cumbersome experience was worth less flexibility for edge cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, this should be a win for most. I am already a happier user.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gallery Block Uses Nested Images</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a link to an Image block within a Gallery.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Gallery block in Gutenberg 11.4 supports <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/25940\">nesting individual Image blocks</a>. It is currently hidden behind an experimental support flag and must be enabled via the Gutenberg &gt; Experiments settings screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effectively, the Gallery block is now a container. Inserting media still works the same way. The difference is that end-users have access to customize each Image block within a Gallery separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One use case for this feature is to allow users to add custom links around images. However, they now have access to more of the Image block&rsquo;s options, such as custom theme styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gallery-block-refactor-expected-to-land-in-wordpress-5-9\">covered this feature in-depth</a> because it is expected to land in WordPress 5.9, and theme authors should be ready for the transition. This is a breaking change in terms of HTML. Any themer with custom Gallery block styles should test the front-end and editor output before WordPress merges the changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Featured Image Duotone Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Applying a duotone filter to the Post Featured Image block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">While we are still missing an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33789\">image size control</a>, I will take any Post Featured Image block improvements I can get at this point. The block felt like a second-class citizen for so long that I am giddy about any enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duotone filters, which landed in WordPress 5.8, allow end-users to add a CSS filter over images to control shadow and highlight colors. Themes can register custom ones, or users can modify them. The latest Gutenberg plugin update <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34113\">brings this feature</a> to the Post Featured Image block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change allows theme authors to explore adding some visual flair since the Post Featured Image block is meant for templating or site editing. It still has a long way to go before it is ready for more advanced theme design, but the tools are getting us closer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global Block &ldquo;Gap&rdquo; for Themes</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Highlighting a Paragraph block and its preceding &ldquo;gap&rdquo; (top margin).\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One custom feature that has become commonplace with themes that support the block editor is a &ldquo;global spacing&rdquo; style rule, which controls the whitespace between elements. Gutenberg contributors have noticed this trend and are now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33812\">shipping a standard solution</a> for it. Themes that use a <code>theme.json</code> file will automatically opt into support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gap feature adds a top margin to all adjacent sibling elements within block containers. This creates the space between each block using a standard method. Theme authors can control this via the <code>styles.spacing.blockGap</code> key in their <code>theme.json</code> files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a theme developer, this is one of the most crucial components of block theming from a pure design viewpoint. It is not something to avoid until it lands in WordPress. The time to test and provide feedback is now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also merely a first step. There are pieces left to implement and problems to solve. There is currently an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33991\">open pull request</a> to bring this to editor block controls. There is also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34441\">another ticket</a> for zeroing out the margins for the first and last blocks, which would typically not need any. There are still some open questions on how to best deal with exceptions to the default block gap in the original ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of its unfinished nature, it is an exciting development if you care anything at all about vertical rhythm in design systems.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Sep 2021 00:29:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WordPress Translation Day 2021 Kicks Off September 1, Expanded to Month-Long Event\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=122052\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:227:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-translation-day-2021-kicks-off-september-1-expanded-to-month-long-event?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-translation-day-2021-kicks-off-september-1-expanded-to-month-long-event\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3580:\"<img />WordPress Translation Day 2021\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation Day</a> kicked off today, and the event has been expanded to run from September 1-30 this year. WordPress Polyglots contributors from all over the world will be hosting mini-events throughout the month where they will be translating <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/projects-to-translate/\">themes, plugins, apps, meta, docs, and other important projects.</a>&nbsp;Events will also focus on recruitment, virtual training for new PTEs/GTEs, and general process improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, the event has been a boon for the Polyglots contributor base. In 2020, the teams hosted more than 20 local events, resulting in more than 175,000 strings translated. French, Spanish, and Japanese-language locales logged the most translated strings during the first week last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently seven mini-events <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/wptd-2021/local-events/\">scheduled</a> for 2021 in different locales throughout the month of September. From Portugal to Tehran to Jakarta, contributors are planning sprints to translate popular plugins and WordPress core. In Bengaluru, one of the largest IT hubs in India, organizers will be onboarding new translators, including high school students who are interested in contributing to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Translation Day will also include some <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/wptd-2021/global-events/\">global events</a> during the second half of the month. These events will be hosted in English and contributors of all experience levels are welcome to attend: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Friday, September 17th&nbsp;(time to be announced):&nbsp;</strong>Introduction to WordPress Translation Day</li><li><strong>Sunday, September 19th at 12:00 UTC:</strong>&nbsp;Panel on Polyglots Tools</li><li><strong>Tuesday, September 21st at 11:00 UTC:&nbsp;</strong>Panel on Open Source Translation Communities</li><li><strong>Thursday, September 30th (time to be announced):</strong>&nbsp;Closing Party &ndash; Why do you translate?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Attendees will be able to participate live as the events are broadcasted on YouTube. The final session will recap the month&rsquo;s events, highlight success stories, and will also include some activities and games. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year translators are extending their volunteer efforts to some newer projects, including working with the Training Team to translate video workshops hosted on learn.wordpress.org, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/07/07/tuesday-trainings-how-to-translate-community-team-resources/\">translating Community team resources</a>, translating the <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/patterns/core/\">Block Patterns project</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/pattern-directory/\">translating</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">Pattern Directory</a>&nbsp;itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The global events combined with the local mini-events are essentially like a virtual Polyglots WordCamp held over the span of a month. Attendees will have opportunities to connect with other translators and team leaders and share their experiences contributing to WordPress.

I studied software engineering at a private university, I&#8217;m white, straight, handsome, and I live in Taco land.</p>\n<p>I could have easily joined a multinational but there was always something that stopped me. It was probably that I felt I didn&#8217;t fit into the office world.</p>\n<p>My friends became engineers looking to create video games. Someone succeeded there, but then the company where he worked was closed. All I knew was that I wanted to do something with computers and graphics. You study the closest thing to what you have in your head but the reality is always different.</p>\n<p>I like programming but I am not passionate about it. I’m in love with visuals, so creating web pages with a platform as friendly as WordPress fit perfectly with my profile. Since I like to write and join puzzles, plugins and now Gutenberg blocks have made literally everything fit in my work.</p>\n<p>Working for projects instead of for a single company has given me the opportunity to see many worlds.</p>\n<h3>The word WordPress has given me a lot in life</h3>\n<p>Like when a client found me on Google searching for a specialist WordPress developer to ensure that a film festival website was always online.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With WordPress magical things can happen, such as getting to know Brazil thanks to this project and since I had continuity, they looked for me again for the next edition to go back in person.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But then you learn some business.</p>\n<p>I put the condition that they also pay the plane ticket to my then girlfriend. I threw in such a condition thinking that they would not do it, but it was accepted.</p>\n<p>And you think: budgets must be exercised and the peace of mind of having someone in person is worth more than you think.</p>\n<h3>With WordPress, every time you give it comes back to you</h3>\n<p>Like when in 2013 I opened the help group on Facebook: WordPress Guadalajara and by sharing bits of my daily knowledge, people began to position me as the person they should turn to.</p>\n<p>It is not that you share knowledge for the benefit, but somehow it always multiplies. In the community you meet people who inspire you and who make you reflect on where you stand and thanks to whom.</p>\n<p>I want to talk now about my wife, she is also white and privileged. She did not finish university because she has always been rather self-taught, she dropped out when she realized that the level was not what she was looking for, so she found great teachers outside. She sells her drawings and for a long time she made more money than me.</p>\n<p>Besides life, money is something we share. I sold her website to her ten years ago and she is the most talented artist I know, <a href=\"https://instagram.com/dianamartinart\">you should meet her.</a></p>\n<p>One day an acquaintance dared to ask me what it felt like for her to pay the bills. When you are young it makes you want to argue with everyone. What makes me laugh is that at some point my wife is going to make a lot more money than me again. In the meantime it&#8217;s nice to move forward together in Taco Land.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As time goes by, you realize that it is a good idea to choose your battles. And that there are things that you can achieve little by little if you have enough continuity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For many years they asked me if I continued making web pages, or if that making pages was still profitable&#8230;</p>\n<p>Making web pages is a fundamental part of my life. Along with the tacos, my dogs and my wife.</p>\n<p>It seems that if you offer a good service, making web pages turns out to be more stable than working for any multinational. So it has been for me.</p>\n<p>Even in the pandemic I have had more clients than ever, of course, helped by a great team such as my partner and star web designer, Nina, who taught me how specialists who work independently for the common good can join together.</p>\n<h1 id=\"espanol\">Ser freelancer puede ser lo más estable en el país de los tacos</h1>\n<p>Soy una persona con mucha suerte. Estudié una ingeniería de software en una universidad privada, soy blanco, heterosexual, guapo y vivo en el país de los tacos.</p>\n<p>Fácilmente pude unirme a una multinacional pero siempre hubo algo que me lo impidió. Probablemente fue que sentía que no encajaba en el mundo de las oficinas.</p>\n<p>Mis amigos se hicieron ingenieros buscando crear videojuegos. Por ahí uno lo logró pero luego cerraron la empresa donde trabajaba. Yo lo único que sabía era que quería hacer algo gráfico con computadoras. Uno estudia lo más parecido a lo que tiene en su cabeza pero la realidad siempre es otra.</p>\n<p>Me gusta la programación pero no me apasiona. A mí me enamoras con lo visual y la creación de páginas web con una plataforma tan amigable como WordPress encajó perfecto con mi perfil. Como me gusta redactar y unir rompecabezas, los plugins y ahora los bloques de Gutenberg han hecho que literalmente todo encaje en mi trabajo.</p>\n<p>Trabajar por proyectos en vez de para una sola empresa me ha brindado la oportunidad de conocer muchos mundos.</p>\n<h3>La palabra WordPress me ha dado mucho en la vida</h3>\n<p>Como cuando una clienta me encontró en Google buscando a un desarrollador especialista en WordPress para garantizar que el sitio web de un festival de cine estuviera siempre en línea.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Con WordPress pueden pasar cosas mágicas, como conocer Brasil gracias a este proyecto y si tienes continuidad, que te vuelvan a buscar para la siguiente edición y volver a ir presencialmente.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pero entonces aprendes de negocios.</p>\n<p>Puse la condición de que también le pagaran el boleto de avión a mi en ese entonces novia. Yo solté esa condición pensando que no lo harían, pero sí se logró.</p>\n<p>Y piensas: los presupuestos se deben de ejercer y la tranquilidad de tener a alguien presencial vale más de lo que uno cree.</p>\n<h3>Con WordPress cada vez que das se te regresa</h3>\n<p>Como cuando en 2013 abrí el grupo de ayuda en Facebook WordPress Guadalajara y al compartir pedacitos de mis conocimientos diarios la gente me fue ubicando como la persona a la que debían de acudir.</p>\n<p>No es que compartas por el beneficio, pero de alguna manera este se va multiplicando. En la comunidad conoces gente que te inspira y que te hace reflexionar sobre dónde estás parado y gracias a quien.</p>\n<p>Quiero hablar ahora de mi esposa, ella también es blanca y privilegiada. No terminó la universidad porque siempre ha sido más bien autodidacta, se salió cuando se dio cuenta de que el nivel no era lo que buscaba, pero tuvo grandes maestros por fuera. Vende sus dibujos y por mucho tiempo hacía más dinero que yo.</p>\n<p>Además de la vida, el dinero es algo que compartimos. A ella le vendí su sitio web hace diez años y es la artista más talentosa que conozco, <a href=\"https://instagram.com/dianamartinart\">deberías de conocerla.</a></p>\n<p>Una vez un conocido se atrevió a decirme que qué se sentía que ella me mantuviera. Cuando eres joven te dan ganas de discutir con todo mundo. Lo que me da risa es que es muy probable que en algún momento mi esposa vaya a hacer mucho más dinero que yo de nuevo. Pero es bonito avanzar juntos en el país de los tacos.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Conforme pasa el tiempo te das cuenta de que es buena idea elegir tus batallas.

Once the Navigation screen is available by default in the Gutenberg plugin, the team working on the feature will be able to gather more feedback. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The navigation block and navigation screen projects have been underway for quite some time and are a main target for 5.9,&rdquo; Gutenberg lead developer Matias Ventura said in a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/13/preliminary-road-to-5-9/\">post</a> outlining the main focus items planned for the block editor in WordPress 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;A large part of the remaining work is to improve the user experience, reduce complexity, and test as much as possible on themes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors participating in the meeting agreed that in order to move the Navigation screen out of the experimental stage, it will need to have UI/UX feature parity with what will soon be the classic Navigation screen (<strong><code>nav-menus.php</code></strong>). Participants came prepared with notes comparing features from the existing Navigation screen to the new block-based one. These are <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UB6fMaPmQPGr-xf_R0-P3Mjef_Fhe7UJOBc0dir1GjA/edit#gid=0\">listed in a Google doc</a> with a rough priority assignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trudging through the many discrepancies between the two Navigation editing experiences allowed the team to update the project&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29102\">tracking issue</a> on GitHub. It is being reorganized to focus on the tasks required to move the block-based Navigation screen out of &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; status. Nearly two dozen issues have been designated as high priority and 32 are marked as normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work on the Navigation screen has stalled considerably since it was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-block-based-navigation-and-widgets-screens-sidelined-for-wordpress-5-5\">sidelined from consideration for WordPress 5.5</a> in July 2020. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22931\">previous tracking issue</a> for the project became obsolete in February, forcing the creation of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29102\">a new one</a> that now aggregates all of the priority items for moving block-based Navigation forward. The recorded Hallway Hangout was a transparent discussion about what the UI is lacking and where it needs to go. It was a necessary, albeit tedious, accounting of issues that will get the project back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UI is still in a very rough state. Nesting is rudimentary. It&rsquo;s not possible to assign menu locations. Adding menu items between existing items is very difficult, among a number of other critical issues. At this point, it would require an extraordinary effort to extract the block-based Navigation screen from its quagmiry state in order to have it ready for prime time in WordPress 5.9. The release is expected in December 2021 &ndash; just three months away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Smith, who facilitated the meeting, tempered expectations for the block-based Navigation screen with a few clarifications for what it will mean to take the feature out from under the &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; flag:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We wouldn&rsquo;t commit to feature parity of&nbsp;<em>developer</em>&nbsp;focused APIs at this stage.</li><li>Removing &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; in the Gutenberg&nbsp;<em>plugin</em>, would not automatically make the feature ready for merging into Core (that won&rsquo;t happen until WordPress 5.9&nbsp;<em>at the earliest</em>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While the block-based Navigation screen landing in 5.9 doesn&rsquo;t seem likely, contributors&rsquo; recent organizational efforts put them well on their way towards getting the project out from under the &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; flag.

I have an idea for a product. I know the market well, I&rsquo;m part of the target audience, and I just need someone else that would be passionate and interested in the idea just as much as myself to have to agree to work on an open-source project. Tinder for project partners?</p><cite>Derin</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">If I am being honest, your question reminds me of my cousin. He is what I call an &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; guy. Every few weeks or so, he calls me up with several new rough concepts of things that could make some money. Most of these conversations end with him asking if I could build him a website or an app. &ldquo;We can split the profits 50/50,&rdquo; he would say. I then tell him that I would rather be paid upfront and show him my rates. He can reap 100% of the profits down the line. He moves on to the next thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, he has loads of ideas. His problem is with the follow-through. Anyone can dream up the perfect product or service. The stumbling blocks tend to be all the steps between concept and production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be hard to sell any legitimate developer on a dream alone. Feeding, sheltering, and clothing one&rsquo;s family comes first. You must have a way to pay for those things in almost all scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have built projects on nothing but faith with others. Some have worked out. Most have not. Having cash on hand to pay for those months in development will provide a smidgeon of security for the programmer putting in the time to turn a dream into reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those projects I completed for my cousin in my younger and less-financially-intelligent days was a hunting and fishing &ldquo;magazine&rdquo; website. It actually saw some early success. The accompanying Facebook group grew to about 1,500 members in the first year or so. The audience was there, but there was no business plan. There were no products or services. No advertising deals. No payday coming for Justin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know 100s of developers who have been in the same boat at one point or another. Most of them wise up after the first project or two that goes nowhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most dream projects that folks build will be personal itches that they are scratching. If there is no guarantee of a paycheck, it is something they are already passionate about. It sounds like that is the sort of person you want to work with, so you will need to find someone likely already motivated about the same market as you. Without knowing your particular market, it is hard to say where your starting point might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us assume your idea is the Next Big Thing. If you need someone on the development end, you should be prepared to take on the other roles to make the project successful. Do you have a business plan? What is your marketing approach? Do you have research that shows there is a market for the idea? Mockups of a potential UI? If you want to pitch someone on coming along for your journey, make sure you have done everything possible to show that it is something worthwhile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where to find that elusive partner, though? It tends to be easier to find open doors when you are involved in the WordPress development community. It is about making connections. That can be through blogging or joining a business-friendly community like <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\">Post Status</a>. The more involved you are, the more people you can meet who may share your passions or be able to point you to others who do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My usual advice would be to visit your local WordCamp to meet others in person. Of course, during this Covid-era, such conferences are virtual. There are tons of online-only <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/category/wordcamps-meetups\">events</a> that can help you connect with people in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those human-to-human connections are your foundation, even if they are just over the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do like the notion of a &ldquo;Tinder&rdquo; for WordPress project partners, or at least some type of networking place for folks. That could be a unique site and service you could build without a developer &mdash; just a domain, hosting plan, and a business model. It could even be the launchpad for finding the partner for your dream project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all else fails, there is always the DIY route &mdash; I am guessing you are not a developer. Many plugin authors have been born from a dream and not a lick of coding knowledge. I started in this industry primarily because I needed my website to have specific functionality. With no money to pay for it, I just started learning. I even enjoyed the art of programming and built a semi-successful business that I ran for over a decade. It is not some magical skill that only a certain few possess. Anyone can pick up the trade with time and effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do not have a developer in your corner, that may just need to be one of the hats you must wear as you kick-start your project. Once you start turning a profit, you can hire out that position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have probably not adequately answered your question. The truth is that anything I have ever done with success has started by connecting with others in the WordPress community. So, I am going to kick this can down to our readers. How would you approach finding the right development partner for a great idea?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 23:10:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: Automattic Acquires Frontity, Founders to Work Full-Time on Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121918\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:201:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-frontity-founders-to-work-full-time-on-gutenberg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=automattic-acquires-frontity-founders-to-work-full-time-on-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4928:\"<img />Frontity co-founders Pablo Postigo and Luis<br />Herranz\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> has <a href=\"https://frontity.org/blog/frontity-is-joining-automattic/\">acquired Frontity</a>, the company behind an open source framework for building WordPress themes with React. The acquisition comes more than a year after the company <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/frontity-raises-e1m-with-automattic-and-k-fund\">raised &euro;1M in funding</a> in a round led by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kfund.co/\">K Fund</a>, with Automattic covering 22%. Frontity co-founders Pablo Postigo and Luis Herranz and their team will no longer be developing and maintaining the framework. Their new focus will be on contributing to the WordPress open source project and improving the full site editing developer experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;After a series of conversations, Automattic offered to sponsor our team to work directly on the WordPress open source project,&rdquo; Frontity&rsquo;s founders said in the announcement. &ldquo;In particular, to contribute our expertise in developer experience, frontend tooling, performance, and UX to the WordPress core itself, instead of doing so only for an external tool.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a separate <a href=\"https://frontity.org/frontity-automattic-qa/\">FAQ document</a>, Frontity clarified that this acquisition does not mean the framework will be merged into WordPress, nor does it mean the team plans to bring React into the WordPress PHP or full site editing themes. The founders intend to apply their expertise to the Gutenberg project full time: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Even though Frontity is a React framework, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that we are going to push React to the WordPress frontend. We will look at the Gutenberg and full site editing space to identify those areas in which our work could have the most significant impact, and work closely with the WordPress community to help improve its developer experience.</p><p>WordPress is already the best content platform on the web. We want to help it become the best development platform on the web.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to putting the Frontity team on improving developer experience, Automattic is also investing in other ways that expand its support of the Gutenberg project. The company has recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sparklingrobots/status/1422299507388125203\">hired a new head of developer relations</a> who is building out a team tasked with improving the developer experience with Gutenberg and full-site editing. Birgit Pauli-Haack is a new member of that team and Automattic is also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bph/status/1432272585404915713\">sponsoring</a> her curation of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gutenbergtimes\">Gutenberg Times</a> publication and the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gutenberg-changelog/id1469294475\">Changelog Podcast</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frontity Framework Will Transition to a Community-Led Project</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the result of the acquisition and the team&rsquo;s reassignment to working on Gutenberg, Frontity&rsquo;s founders are transitioning the framework to be a community-led project. The team has prepared to leave the project in &ldquo;a stable, bug-free position,&rdquo; with documentation regarding what features they were working on. The framework is used by many companies and agencies, including high profile sites like the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/\">TikTok Creator Portal</a>, popular Catholic news site <a href=\"https://aleteia.org/\">Aleteia</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.diariomotor.com/\">Diariomotor</a>, a popular Spanish automotive publication. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As far as we know, Automattic is not using Frontity Framework in any of its products,&rdquo; Frontity CEO and co-founder Pablo Postigo said. &ldquo;But we know there are a lot of Automatticians who have been following our progress closely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are aware that WordPress VIP does recommend Frontity for decoupled solutions, too. We are sure our experience and knowledge might be of help for this team as well.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center text-center\">The departure of Frontity&rsquo;s founders and team introduces some uncertainty into the future of the framework. When asked if it can survive as a community-led project, Postigo was optimistic but not certain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We still think that Frontity Framework is the best way to run a decoupled WordPress site with React and that this will be the case for a long time,&rdquo; Postigo said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It is still too early to know what will happen. Frontity has a great community behind it, there are a lot of great projects which are using the framework in production, and there&rsquo;s also a nice group of really active contributors. We feel really positive about the future of the framework.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 00:47:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Announce Your Plugin to the World, Shout It From the Rooftop\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114661\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:183:\"https://wptavern.com/announce-your-plugin-to-the-world-shout-it-from-the-rooftop?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=announce-your-plugin-to-the-world-shout-it-from-the-rooftop\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6075:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The easiest way to kill your WordPress plugin is to fail to let the world know about it. If you cannot manage a tweet, blog post, or quick note on Facebook, you may as well sign the death certificate then and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. I have been there. Not everyone is a marketing guru, so putting out the right messaging might seem like speaking in a foreign language. But no messaging at all? That will not bode well for your young project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of my job is finding plugins and sharing them with the community. Every week, I am on the lookout for that next great idea. Or, at least, a sort-of-good idea. I scour Twitter, regular blogs that I read, and official WordPress directories for plugins and themes. What I like most about writing about our beloved platform is not big business deals or the latest drama. While those pieces can be fun, I am most interested in what people create on top of the software. Whether a large company or an individual builds a new plugin, I am always excited when Monday rolls around. I can begin my search anew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, I will find a new plugin that looks promising, so I dive into it. I install and activate it. At times, I find something so interesting that I have no choice but to share it. However, most of the time, I need a little push. To understand &ldquo;the why&rdquo; behind it. I do a quick check to see if they have written a blog post, tweeted about it, or shared it in some way. More often than not, nothing exists about it other than its listing in the plugin directory. And, reaching out to devs via email is often a hit-or-miss affair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you do not announce your new project to the world, it feels like you are not passionate about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand that some people simply hash out an idea and decide to drop it in the plugin directory. They are not in it for glory or even recognition. For them, it is just a piece of code they thought might come in hand for others. But, usage is the lifeblood of software. If no one else downloads, installs, and activates your plugin, can we really call it software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the proverbial tree falling in the forest, whether it makes a sound is irrelevant if no one is around to hear it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been mulling over whether to finishing writing this post for months, unsure if I was ever going to hit the publish button. I initially scratched down some notes in early April, attempting to understand why so few go through the <em>trouble</em> of doing any marketing of their plugins. I reached out to Bridget Willard to get insight from someone with a rich history in the marketing world. She had just published <em><a href=\"https://bridgetwillard.com/how-to-market-your-plugin/\">How To Market Your Plugin</a></em> the month before, so the timing made sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I still felt too frustrated with the status quo in the WordPress community. A message from a reader wishing that we would mention alternative choices for plugin-related posts prompted me to revisit this. The truth is simple. So many projects fly under the radar because their authors begin and end their marketing by submitting to WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Marketing is communication,&rdquo; said Willard. &ldquo;At the basic level, you must &lsquo;tell people&rsquo; you have a product. The basic minimum is a blog post with social posts on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. It&rsquo;s scary to market while you build, but that&rsquo;s what the automobile industry does (along with others). You have to create the desire for the product &mdash; more than fixing a problem.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While she tends to focus on products and services, I asked her what developers should be doing regardless of whether their plugins are commercial or free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I advocate with all of my being having a landing page on your main site (not a new site) promoting your plugin &mdash; while you&rsquo;re building it,&rdquo; paraphrasing from a chapter in her book. &ldquo;Take signups for beta testers, start email marketing. The blog post is anti-climatic in many ways, and one or two tweets aren&rsquo;t enough. Even better is to customize the sign-up &lsquo;thank you page&rsquo; with something special &mdash; a video talking about your goals, for example. It&rsquo;s not the time to have a tutorial or demo. This is about communicating your vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The sad thing is that many plugin developers don&rsquo;t see the need to spend money on a &lsquo;free&rsquo; plugin. The axiom is true, &lsquo;it takes money to make money.&rsquo; If you want sales, you need marketing. The sale for a free plugin is a download, and those are just as important.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of me missed the old <a href=\"https://weblogtoolscollection.com/\">Weblog Tools Collection</a> era. Every few days, the site would share a post with the latest plugins (themes too) with short descriptions of each. It was an easy win if you had no marketing skills. Developers could submit their new projects, and the team would share them with the community. When I was a young and upcoming developer, it was one of the only ways I knew how to reach folks in the WordPress community aside from pushing stuff from my own blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we have far more avenues for sharing our work via social networking. Of course, the downside is that you have to cut through the noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, I would like to see an overhaul of the WordPress.org directory, focusing on the discoverability of plugins by feature instead of <em>only</em> popularity. Not all developers are known for their marketing skills. Having a little help from the directory they feed into could make it easier for budding developers to jump from hobby to business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until then, let the world know about your plugin. Even if it seems like you are shouting into the abyss, you may just hear an answer from someone who noticed your passion. If nothing else, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/contact\">let us know about it</a> here at WP Tavern.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 23:10:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"Matt: Frontity to Join Automattic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=54707\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://ma.tt/2021/08/frontity-to-join-automattic/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1135:\"<p>Since Frontity <a href=\"https://docs.frontity.org/getting-started/quick-start-guide\">launched their open source framework</a>, they have been making the integration between React and WordPress easier.

It was clear that a different approach would be needed for the next iteration. <strong>Glen Davies</strong> spearheaded the Refactor of the Gallery block. The main change was to use the <code>InnerBlock</code> feature to create Galleries as collection of single image blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This empowers content creators to assign different styles and links to individual images of the Gallery. Although the refactor progressed well, it didn&#8217;t make it into WordPress 5.8 as backwards compatibility with the earlier version and migration for existing gallery blocks needed more attention. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code changes made it into the Gutenberg plugin and are available via the Experiments section.

Since then, the Training Team has continued adding more material. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2021/08/10/proposal-learner-achievements-on-profiles/\">latest proposal </a>is an open discussion for the community on adding participatory badges for completing coursework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to nail down what kind of thing we would like to see regarding recognising learner achievements on profiles,&rdquo; wrote WordPress community manager Hugh Lashbrooke in the announcement earlier this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal, which now has a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/learn/issues/228\">GitHub ticket</a>, includes showing the following on a user&rsquo;s WordPress.org profile page:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A course&rsquo;s completion in the activity stream.</li><li>The user&rsquo;s average grade from Learn WordPress.</li><li>A new &ldquo;Learning&rdquo; tab for displaying completed courses with dates and the possibility of individual completed lessons, relevant grades, and other learning data.</li><li>A new &ldquo;Learner&rdquo; badge for anyone who has completed one course.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, there are only two <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/courses/\">courses available</a>. &ldquo;That is changing as we develop new content,&rdquo; wrote Lashbrooke in the post. &ldquo;So my hope is that we will have these rewards in place now, and as content is created, the rewards will flow naturally.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One downside to the proposal may be publicly showing a user&rsquo;s grades. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be against showing the learner&rsquo;s average grade publicly because it could lead to anxiety, stress, etc., and maybe even stop some people from participating in the courses,&rdquo; wrote Stephen Cronin in the comments. &ldquo;Eg: &lsquo;What if I only get a C, will anyone take me seriously? Will it harm my chances of getting a job in the WP space?&rsquo; etc. Some people will thrive on that sort of competition, some people &hellip; not so much. And I feel like we should be as inclusive as possible.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lashbrooke responded that showing grades could be an opt-in feature. However, I would question why it would be necessary to show grades at all. <em>Bragging rights?</em> Maybe. If we could somehow make it shareable via social media, it might be a fun way to get more people to participate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several people in the comments were encouraged by the idea of social sharing. Adam Warner even proposed adding the Learn badges to the oEmbed WordPress block, making it easy for users to share their accomplishments on their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the first step should be to provide badges for completing a course. It is an easy win and could be automated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most user profile badges are for direct contributions to the project, such as writing code or working on a team. However, at least some user-based participatory badges are available already. For example, there is a &ldquo;Test Contributor&rdquo; badge for providing feedback on calls for testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One side advantage of a Learn achievement system could be for employers who are looking through an applicant&rsquo;s history. It may help potential employees show off their competency in specific areas of the WordPress platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Engle Robertson, Web Design and Developer Advocate at GoDaddy, questioned Matt Mullenweg during 2020&rsquo;s State of the Word Q&amp;A session on the role of the Learn platform as it pertains to the job market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg said the first step is organizing the platform and making high-quality educational material available. However, he seemed open to the idea of having a self or administered certification down the line. It would allow people to show that they have completed or tested out of a course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a perfect system, but it could be a nice way for people to learn more about WordPress,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And, hopefully, as they go through, since WordPress is open-source, improve the materials as we go through it, both from the point of view of making it more intuitive or easier to understand and also translating, as well. Because there is a huge demand for WordPress really all over the world now.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>View the clip below from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2020/12/17/matt-mullenweg-2020-state-of-the-word-qa/\">State of the Word Q&amp;A</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As someone who hires WordPress professionals, I would love to have a request in the job application to link up their WP profile so we can see competency through that learning platform,&rdquo; commented Chris Badgett, the founder and CEO of LifterLMS, on the proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also agreed with Mullenweg that people should be able to test out of a course. It would not make sense for those who have already acquired specific skills or knowledge to go through the motions of completing coursework they are already proficient in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Creating quizzes or &lsquo;post tests&rsquo; in the LMS with a standard minimum passing requirement to earn the achievement badge would help fulfill this,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, some simple gamification via profile badges could boost participation and, perhaps, get more people involved in contributing to the Learn platform. This could also be the first step toward a WordPress certification system.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 00:39:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 22) — Dealing With Developer Overload: Organization\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=85744\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://poststatus.com/excerpt/22/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3678:\"<h2 id=\"h-we-can-be-organized-in-how-we-multitask\">We Can Be Organized In How We Multitask.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In this episode, David and Cory have a conversation about another way to prevent Developer Overload: organization.

It introduces several new features that were previously experimental, closing out tickets that were started by previous owner Elliot Condon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release enables HTML escaping by default, which helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It runs content rendered by ACF through the WordPress&nbsp;<code>wp_kses()</code>&nbsp;function. There was a little confusion about how this works and the release post has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wp_acf/status/1430906074593304589\">updated</a> to clarify:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to note that this only affects content rendered by ACF in your WordPress dashboard or any front-end forms rendered through&nbsp;<code>acf_form()</code>,&rdquo; Iain Poulson said. &ldquo;This will not affect field values loaded through API functions such as&nbsp;<code>get_field()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>the_field()</code>. We don&rsquo;t make any assumptions about where you are using your field values within your theme and do not escape to them as a result.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 5.10 also introduces support for the WordPress Blocks API v2 for ACF blocks. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/18/block-api-version-2/\">WordPress 5.6</a> came with a new Block API that makes it easier for theme and plugin developers to style the block content with more consistent results matching the front end. The ACF team has created a <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/block-api-v2/\">Block API v2 help doc</a> with examples that help developers update their blocks and make use of the new block filters included in the update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features introduced in this release include block preloading turned on by default, a new full-height setting for blocks, opacity support for the color-picker, and many bug fixes. Next up on the roadmap for the plugin is adding WordPress REST API support to ACF field groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As API-powered JavaScript front-ends become more and more popular in the WordPress space, it&rsquo;s clear that many of our customers want this functionality included in ACF core,&rdquo; Poulson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We also plan to improve the performance of the plugin and work on other quality of life features. Now that our development team has a solid handle on the codebase and the release process, we can start working on these more complicated but long-requested features.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after the acquisition, Delicious Brains representatives published a pinned <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/free-support-expectations-and-response-times-7/\">thread</a> in the forum, clarifying expectations for free support and response times. The official support forum for both free and PRO users can be found at <a href=\"https://support.advancedcustomfields.com/\">support.advancedcustomfields.com</a>, which is more active than the WordPress.org forums. Since the plugin is more developer-focused, the team is taking a looser approach to support by giving the community a place to help each other:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We rarely provide support in either forum.

The event, which was supported by 12 volunteers, helped create websites for 3 non-profits. do_action Karnataka was held completely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it concluded symbolically on August 15th 2021 — the 75th Independence Day of India. This is the second do_action Hackathon in Karnataka — the first one being <a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/bengaluru-2019/\">do_action Bengaluru</a>, which was held in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/karnataka-2021/\">Karnataka 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Efforts behind <a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/karnataka-2021/\">do_action Karnataka</a> kicked off three months prior, in April 2021. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nsuresha/\">N Suresha</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/freewebmentor/\">Prem Tiwari</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ucriyaz/?originalSubdomain=in\">UC Riyaz</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sagarvora786?lang=en\">Sagar Vora</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkatesh-kumar-s-r-945b8821/\">SR Venkatesh</a>, and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yoga1103/\">Yogesh Londhe</a> (myself) from the WordPress Community of Karnataka, joined hands to support local non-profits by helping them build websites. The following non-profits signed up for our hackathon:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Luv Kush Foster Home:</strong> A foster home that aims to care for animals in need</li><li><strong>Vridhi Foundation:</strong> which aims to support the education of underprivileged children</li><li><strong>Peacespark Foundation:</strong> Welfare of women and children</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>12 volunteers immediately signed up to build websites for these non-profits. Not everyone could participate due to personal challenges related to COVID-19, but the teams worked hard to complete the work within the stipulated time. As a result of all that hard work, two non-profit sites were launched, and one is in the pipeline!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peacespark Foundation:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.peacespark.org/\">https://www.peacespark.org/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpressfoundation.org/content/uploads/2021/08/image.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>A screenshot of the Peacespark Foundation website created by the do_action Karnataka 2021 team.\n\n\n\n<p>The website of Peacespark Foundation was built by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkatesh-kumar-s-r-945b8821/\">SR Venkatesh</a> (project manager) and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/harishanker\">Hari Shanker</a> (content writer). Venkatesh collected all the content and the photos from the non-profit, and he was also in constant communication with the team. He also single-handedly designed and developed the website for the team! Since the content manager volunteer could not join on time, Hari stepped in to prepare the content for the site. As a result, the site was ready well within the deadline, and the non-profit was happy and grateful!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vridhi Foundation: </strong><a href=\"https://vridhifoundation.org/\">https://vridhifoundation.org/</a>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpressfoundation.org/content/uploads/2021/08/image-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>A screenshot of the Vridhi Foundation website created by the do_action Karnataka 2021 team.\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nsuresha/\">N Suresha</a> (project manager), along with Hussna Hussain (content writer) and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ucriyaz/?originalSubdomain=in\">UC Riyaz</a> (designer) built the website for Vridhi Foundation. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mkrndmane/\">Makarand Mane</a> helped with the multilingual translation plugin, the theme, and the required templates. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/freewebmentor/\">Prem Tiwari</a> set up the site and provided technical support during the development, as well. Together, the team worked in synergy to burn the midnight oil and deliver the site for the non-profit, which formally launched the same in a function at their premises, on August 15th!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpressfoundation.org/content/uploads/2021/08/image.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Representatives of the Vridhi Foundation at their website launch event on August 15, 2021\n\n\n\n<p>Since representatives of Luv Kush foster home were out of the country during the hackathon,&nbsp; they couldn’t collaborate to give the content and the photos for the website. Most of the technical groundwork for their website is done, and it will formally be launched once the non-profit provides content for the teams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hackathon would not be possible without the support of our kind sponsors who provided hosting, domain names, WordPress plugins/themes, and post hackathon support guarantees for all the non-profits. A big thanks to all of them! Our sponsors include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://givewp.com/\">Give WP</a> &#8211; Who kindly sponsored a premium license for their flagship donation plugin</li><li><a href=\"https://yoast.com/\">Yoast</a> &#8211; Who kindly sponsored a premium license for their SEO plugin</li><li><a href=\"https://themeisle.com/\">Themeisle</a> &#8211; Who provided premium licenses for their theme</li><li><a href=\"https://wpjobopenings.com/\">WP Job Openings</a> &#8211; Who provided a license for their job board plugin</li><li><a href=\"https://wpgenius.in/\">WPGenius</a> &#8211; Who provided a translation plugin, templates, and themes</li><li><a href=\"https://www.premtiwari.in/\">Prem Tiwari</a> &#8211; Who has offered post-hackathon tech support for non-profits</li><li><a href=\"https://bluehost.in/\">Bluehost India</a> &#8211; Who provided hosting and domain names for all three non-profits</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to our sponsors, I wish to thank all stakeholders who helped make our event a grand success — especially our team of passionate volunteers and organizers who battled several personal challenges and a global pandemic to build an ever-lasting online presence for non-profits. Special thanks to the WordPress Foundation for supporting these do_action charity hackathons which empower non-profits across the globe, especially in these tough times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we were wrapping up the event on the final day of the hackathon, I asked our team of organizers and volunteers one question: “Despite all the challenges, would you do this again?” They all answered in one resounding voice: “YES!” <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>On behalf of the do_action Karnataka 2021 Organizing team,<br /><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yoga1103\">Yogesh Londhe</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Feeling inspired, already?

The extension allows end-users to add any HTML attribute to nearly any block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the problems with the WordPress editor is that it can be a bit fussy about customizing HTML. Blocks are built on a set of standards, and the markup is supposed to meet those expectations. If something does not fit, users see an invalid markup warning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are times when users need to drop in a custom HTML attribute for various reasons. For example, I sometimes need to add a custom <code>data-</code> attribute for working with a bit of JavaScript. Since I know my way around code well enough, I typically write out the HTML in those situations via the Custom HTML block. But, that does not make sense when minor attribute additions are called for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress currently allows users to add classes and IDs (called an &ldquo;HTML anchor&rdquo; in the admin) to almost every block. It does not allow for direct input of the dozens of other possible attributes that HTML supports. The use cases for the average user are few and far between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those scenarios where some users could use the extra feature, the Block Attributes plugin is handy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is straightforward to use. It adds a new field named &ldquo;Additional attributes&rdquo; under the Advanced tab of every block. Users can add the attribute name and click the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button. From there, it creates a new field for adding the attribute value.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding an <code>onclick</code> attribute to a Button block.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also supports multiple attributes. Once you add one, you simply use the same input field to create more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my first test drive, I added a simple <code>onclick</code> attribute with a value of <code>myFunction()</code>. Then, I hopped over to my theme and created that function via JavaScript to output a simple message in the console. Everything looked good under the hood, and it worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>HTML view and console with custom JS for a Button block.\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the use cases I have in mind are for integrating with JavaScript, and this was a simple example of what is possible. There are far more complex things a developer could do with such a feature. That is reason enough to keep this plugin in the toolbox &mdash; sometimes you need a wrench instead of a hammer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could also see Block Attributes being used for adding ARIA attributes in other situations where it might aid accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users could add custom styles to a specific block via a <code>style</code> attribute with the plugin. However, unless this is a simple one-off, I would recommend against it. For more advanced use cases, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/blocks-css/\">Blocks CSS</a> is a far more suitable plugin. It has a built-in syntax highlighter. Plus, a textarea is friendlier than a one-line text input box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only downside to Block Attributes I have seen is upon deactivation. You will see the dreaded &ldquo;this block contains unexpected or invalid content&rdquo; message in the editor if you have added any custom attributes. The editor has managed to resolve any issues I have run into with the core blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Resolving block warning after deactivating plugin.\n\n\n\n<p>Deactivating the plugin should not affect the front-end output. Because the custom attributes are a part of the HTML markup, they will still be there. The error message should only show in the editor.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 23:27:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: WordPress Classic Editor Support Extended for at Least Another Year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121553\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:199:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-classic-editor-support-extended-for-at-least-another-year?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-classic-editor-support-extended-for-at-least-another-year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7276:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Last week, I reached out to several members of the core WordPress committers to see if we could get an official word on whether <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor</a> support would continue beyond the mere months it seemingly had left to live. I received a semi-official answer but was asked to hold off on publishing for a more detailed and nuanced response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier today, WordPress executive director Josepha Haden Chomposy <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/08/an-update-on-the-classic-editor-plugin/\">announced the official decision</a>. It was just as expected. The WordPress project would continue supporting the Classic Editor plugin for a while longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;At the time, we promised to support the plugin through 2021 and adjust if needed as the deadline got closer,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;After discussing this with Matt [Mullenweg], it&rsquo;s clear that continuing to support the plugin through 2022 is the right call for the project as well as the community.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, classic users have a one-year extension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the plugin will not suddenly stop working on December 31, 2022. That is merely the current deadline for the &ldquo;full support&rdquo; phase. It should continue working well beyond whatever date is set for that support window to close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designer Mark Root-Wiley reached out to WP Tavern <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MRWweb/status/1427422379047743495\">via Twitter</a> last week, but others had been asking the same question for a while. For some, they needed to know if they could continue supporting specific client needs. For others, it was a bludgeon to use in conversations for all editor-related things. Whatever the reason, before today, the last word had been from a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/\">Make Core post in November 2018</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Classic Editor plugin will be officially supported until December 31, 2021,&rdquo; wrote core contributor Gary Pendergast in that three-year-old announcement. It was a shock for many at the time, uncertain whether the new block system would meet their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While three years may have seemed like plenty of time to ditch the classic in favor of the modern WordPress editor, the current stats show that the project still has a few miles yet to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, there are over 5 million active installations of the Classic Editor plugin. I am still waiting for a more specific tally, but no one has provided an answer yet. At best, we think the counter turns over at 10+ million, so we can speculate on the floor and ceiling for possible usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Active installs are not the entire picture either. For example, we have the plugin installed here at the Tavern for legacy reasons but do not use it in our day-to-day work. We can likely disable it altogether. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-telemetry-proposal-addresses-long-standing-privacy-concerns-as-gdpr-compliance-deadline-looms\">WordPress has no telemetry system</a> for tracking the usage of such features. While the install total will not always make the picture clear, the current number supports the push for continued maintenance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s important to note that the plugin is not going anywhere,&rdquo; said core committer Jonathan Desrosiers. &ldquo;It will continue to be listed on the .ORG repository for the foreseeable future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He pointed out that understanding the next phase of the Classic Editor plugin meant looking into the level of effort required to support it since 2018. The overwhelming majority of the changes in that nearly three-year timeframe have come down to keeping up with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Text changes.</li><li>Adjustments to prevent warnings/errors and promote consistency across supported PHP versions.</li><li>Changes to deprecated action/filter hook calls.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been almost three whole years, and the plugin has largely required very little maintenance to continue functioning, and the bulk of maintenance has been to limit warnings and notices in debug logs,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of the Classic Editor plugin was to help ease the transition to the block editor. Thus far, there have been eight major WordPress releases since the switch in version 5.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a theory called the diffusion of innovations that looks to explain how, why, and at what rate new technology spreads,&rdquo; said Desrosiers. &ldquo;It separates adopters into several groups based on when they are willing to take the jump: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. I truly think that we have seen a good portion of the late majority beginning to move towards using the block editor. This can also be confirmed by the plugin&rsquo;s install growth, which has been slowing and plateauing this year.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had expected the previous deadline to mark the next stage of the Classic Editor plugin, called the &ldquo;sunset&rdquo; phase. It would be a time when the WordPress project moved from full support to encouraging late adopters to transition to the current editor to get the plugin&rsquo;s numbers down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The context I gave previously shows that, until now, that the level of effort needed to keep the plugin working on newer versions of WP has been pretty minimal,&rdquo; said Desrosiers of the potential sunset phase. &ldquo;I expect that pattern to continue thanks to backward compatibility. If any security issues or major problems are encountered, they&rsquo;ll, of course, be fixed. Any incompatibilities with the plugin and newer versions of WP will be considered on a case by case basis, but little to no time will be put towards bug fixes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this sunset phase will have to wait.

I dabbled in coding with HTML and CSS had one website go live within 3 months, but everybody who has done coding, also know, that it is very time consuming, something as a mom, I don’t have much of. I made the decision to not pursue my dream of website designing. But I never gave up on that dream.</p>\n<p>Right now, I am a 41 mom of two teenagers, ages 17 and 12, I was pretty set in my ways in terms of my career for a very long time. But when getting closer to my 40’s, I knew I wanted more. I knew I had the capabilities for WordPress, but never had to opportunity or given the chance to dabble in it.</p>\n<h3>How It All Began</h3>\n<p>My journey in Graphic Design started way back in 2003 with Photoshop Version 6 and Coreldraw X3. I loved it right from the start, but knew there was more to graphic design, then just that. Websites was a pretty new thing to me, but always felt intrigued by it.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to the beginning of 2020, 17 years later with loads of experience in Graphic Design, it was time for a change. There was always this gap, that just couldn’t get filled in terms of my career. Yet, I still remembered my dream. On 3 February 2020, I started a new job, but still in graphics and just before Covid hit our shores. Needless to say, that job turned into a freelance work from home job.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was a really rocky period financially, as in freelancing, you get paid for what you do, and it just wasn’t happening.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In August of the same year, I received a text from someone, wanting to know if I am still available for work, knowing that I don’t know anything about Website/WordPress design. I had a background in HTML and CSS, but not enough. I still got the job, it’s not a high paying salary, but I get to work from home.</p>\n<h3>Everything After</h3>\n<p>WordPress changed my life in a big way, I don’t know other WordPress designers as I am self-taught. Fortunately, with Google and Youtube, as well as some connections made with the new job, my journey in WordPress started.</p>\n<p>I have designed 4 websites that I maintain, with another one that is under construction as well as one or two more in the pipeline.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I asked a lot of questions when all this happened, like why did this happen?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Why did it have to be me? A year later, I know the answer. I had to go through some struggles to really learn the value of what we have, it’s not how much you have, but what you have. At the moment, I work from home and absolutely love what I do.</p>\n<p>If there is one lesson to be learnt from my story, don’t give up on your dreams, you are never too old to achieve that dream and be really good at it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"afrikaans\">Moet nooit jou drome laat vaar nie</h1>\n<p>Vir jare en jare wou ek altyd webwerwe doen. Ek het begin om met HTML en CSS te kodeer, het een webwerf binne 3 maande gehad, maar almal wat kodering doen weet dat dit baie tydrowend is, iets wat ek as &#8216;n ma, nie veel van het nie. Ek het die besluit geneem om nie my droom van webwerf-ontwerp na te streef nie. Maar ek het nooit die droom opgegee nie.</p>\n<p>Huidiglik, is ek is &#8216;n 41 jarige ma van twee tieners, hulle is 17 en 12 jaar oud. Ek was baie lank gevestig in my loopbaan. Maar hoe nader ek aan my veertigerjare gekom het, het ek geweet, ek wou ek meer hê. Ek het geweet dat ek die vermoëns vir WordPress gehad het, maar ek het nooit die geleentheid gehad of was nooit geoffer om dit te gebruik nie.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">Hoe dit alles begin het</span></h3>\n<p>My reis in grafiese ontwerp het al in 2003 begin met Photoshop weergawe 6 en Coreldraw X3. Ek was van die begin af mal daaroor, maar ek het geweet dat daar meer aan grafiese ontwerp was, dan net dit. Webwerwe was vir my &#8216;n redelike nuwe ding, maar ek was altyd daarin gefassineer.</p>\n<p>Spoed vorentoe na die begin van 2020, 17 jaar later en met baie ervaring in grafiese ontwerp, dit tyd vir &#8216;n verandering. Daar was altyd hierdie leemte wat in my loopbaan net nie gevul kon word nie. Tog onthou ek nog my droom. Op 3 Februarie 2020 het ek &#8216;n nuwe werk begin, maar nog steeds in grafies en net voor covid ons oewers getref het. Nodeloos om te sê, die werk het verander na &#8216;n vryskutwerk wat van die huis af gedoen was.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dit was finansieel &#8216;n baie rotsagtige periode, met vryskut werk, word jy betaal vir wat jy doen, ek het gesien, dit gaan nie werk nie.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In Augustus van dieselfde jaar het ek &#8216;n whatsapp van iemand ontvang wat wil weet of ek nog beskikbaar is vir werk. In die wete dat ek niks weet van webwerf of WordPress &#8211; ontwerp nie. Ek het &#8216;n agtergrond in html en css gehad, maar dit was nie genoeg nie. Ek het nog steeds die pos gekry, dit is nie &#8216;n hoë salaris nie, maar ek werk van die huis af.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">Alles Daarna</span></h3>\n<p>WordPress het my lewe grootliks verander, ek ken nie ander WordPress ontwerpers nie, aangesien ek myself geleer het. Gelukkig, met Google en Youtube, asook &#8216;n paar verbintenisse met die nuwe werk, het my reis in WordPress begin.</p>\n<p>Ek het vier webwerwe ontwerp wat ek onderhou, met nog een wat gebou word, asook nog een of twee wat in die pyplyn is.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ek het baie vrae gevra toe dit alles gebeur het, soos hoekom het dit gebeur?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Waarom moes dit ek wees? &#8216;n Jaar later weet ek die antwoord. Ek moes bietjie sukkel om werklik die waarde van wat ons het te leer, dit is nie hoeveel jy het nie, maar wat jy het. Op die oomblik werk ek tuis en hou absoluut van wat ek doen.</p>\n<p>As daar een les uit my verhaal is om te leer is, moenie moed opgee om jou drome te volg nie; jy is nooit te oud om die droom te verwesenlik nie.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/never-give-up-on-your-dreams/\">Never give up on your dreams &#8211; Moet nooit jou drome laat vaar nie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 06:01:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Pam Woest\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WPTavern: Google Search Completes Rollout of Link Spam Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121791\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:167:\"https://wptavern.com/google-search-completes-rollout-of-link-spam-update?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=google-search-completes-rollout-of-link-spam-update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3293:\"<p>Google announced today that it has completed its rollout of the link spam update, which was started a month ago. In an effort to combat sites using spammy links to manipulate rankings, the search engine has developed more effective ways to identify and nullify link spam across multiple languages. The update took a couple weeks longer than anticipated but the algorithmic changes that re-assess the ranking of improperly qualified links has now been fully rolled out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commercial linking can be differentiated from link spam by <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/qualify-outbound-links\">specifying the appropriate <code>rel</code>&nbsp;attribute</a>. For example, affiliate links must be identified to the search engine by <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/qualify-outbound-links\">&nbsp;rel=&rdquo;sponsored&rdquo;</a> in order to not trigger any negative effects from the most recent update. Website owners and content creators should be aware of the search engine&rsquo;s requirements when publishing affiliate links or sponsored/guest posts. While it is appropriate and ethical to disclose commercial links in the content of the post, this is no longer sufficient for Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/07/link-tagging-and-link-spam-update\">post</a> on the Google Search Central blog warns that this update carries a more strict response for sites that do not properly qualify commercial links:  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When we detect sites engaging in either publishing or acquiring links with excessive sponsored and guest posting without proper link tags, algorithmic and manual actions may be applied, similar to affiliate links.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress users who rely on plugins to manage sponsored and affiliate links will want to check to ensure they support the proper tagging for commercial links. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pretty-link/\">Pretty Links</a>, a link management and tracking plugin used by more than 300,000 WordPress sites, added support for the sponsored rel tag in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pretty-link/#developers\">version 3.1.0</a>, along with sponsored toggle support in the block and TinyMCE editors. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/thirstyaffiliates/\">ThirstyAffiliates</a>, another popular plugin active on more than 40,00 installs, has a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/requirement-to-use-sponsored-tag-for-affiliate-links/\">global setting for adding rel attribute tags</a> to links, which can also be adjusted on a per-link basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The are many other affiliate link management, tracking, and cloaking plugins out there that may not have been updated with settings for easily designating <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/qualify-outbound-links\"><code>rel</code></a>attributes in links. Those who do not want to have negative effects from the link spam update may need the ability to bulk update their links to comply. If you rely on a link management plugin, it&rsquo;s a good idea to check the plugin&rsquo;s settings, and alternatively the plugin&rsquo;s changelog, to see what features are supported. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 04:00:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WPTavern: Why Did You Start Using WordPress?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121794\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:131:\"https://wptavern.com/why-did-you-start-using-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-did-you-start-using-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5067:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">If there was a question that ever made me start feeling old, it might be this one. Last week, Marcel Bootsman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbootsman/status/1428407620273049605\">asked via Twitter</a>, &ldquo;Why did you start to use WordPress?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress community members chimed in with all sorts of reasons for hopping aboard, and Jeff Chandler of WP Mainline <a href=\"https://wpmainline.com/2021/08/19/the-one-feature-that-got-me-to-start-using-wordpress/\">shared his journey</a> on his site. These are the sort of discussions of nostalgia that I live for. What follows is my story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I began blogging in 2003. A friend had introduced me to a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/2pwkgu/does_anyone_remember_expagecom/\">now-defunct service called Expage</a>. We mostly used it similarly to the early Myspace craze, adding things such as shout-outs to friends, random GIFs, scrolling marquee text, and midi files that blared as soon as a visitor landed on the page. But, I soon began learning how to link together multiple &ldquo;Expages&rdquo; (you only got one page), eventually building something of a journal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After realizing the limitations of creating multiple accounts and passwords for different pages, I found Yahoo! GeoCities. After a short-lived stint with the service and being stifled by its roadblocks, I soon upgraded to a web hosting plan offered by Yahoo! with full PHP support. That meant I could do dynamic things like having multiple text files to store my blog post entries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, began my journey into building my own blogging system. Over the next couple of years, I kept my online journal open to the world with what felt like duct tape and old-fashioned grit. I tried WordPress at some point along the way and took a dive into PHP-Nuke and a couple of others. I then jumped back to my own system. I knew just enough PHP to be a flashing beacon for hacker-bots to push those little blue pills if they had ever bothered looking in my direction. Of course, my blog was so obscure that its glaring security holes did not register on any radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a week after I turned 21. On May 8, 2005, I had decided to get serious &mdash; yet again &mdash; about fixing my digital playground of a website. I would ditch any efforts of moving everything over to WordPress or another CMS. I was a lone wolf and was going to trek into the world <em>wild</em> web with nothing but my existing knowledge and instincts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a fun era on the web for me. I was also a college student with an ever-changing list of interests, often varying by the day. Building a custom blogging system has never been an easy feat, and managing it all through plain text files had become a burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mere five days later, I caved on my dream of managing a custom platform, but I needed to do so for my own sanity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I simply began using WordPress because it made it easy to manage blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no special features like the editor, custom post types, or anything else that has brought so many others to the project. It was simply having a nicely organized posts management screen and the output of those posts on the front end. Relative to other systems at the time, it was also easy to install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, I probably did not think much of it. It was just another project in a line of others that I had tested, but I am happy I took the leap. WordPress has given me a career and, often, a purpose in life. It allowed me to grow as a developer, designer, and writer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be blasphemy to say such things in WordPress circles, but my personal blog no longer runs on our beloved platform. After all these years, I have come full circle. My original goal was to build a flat-file blogging system, even though I did not know there was a name for such a thing back in the early-to-mid 2000s. I also did not have the requisite knowledge to build it at the time. However, in 2018, I coded my own system from scratch, and I loved every minute of that initial build. In part, I had a new project to tinker with, but it also carried a bit of the nostalgic factor of re-pioneering my early foray into the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a custom blogging platform works for my own purposes, it makes me appreciate WordPress even more. It is hard to understand how much work goes into something as seemingly simple as the front-end architecture until you build it from the ground up. And, let us just skip over any talk of creating a secure and accessible admin interface that is user-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any serious endeavor, WordPress is still my go-to solution &mdash; <em>my personal site is a playground where I can afford to break things, after all</em>. After our 16-year relationship, I do not see that changing at any point soon. As always, something exciting is around the corner. The platform keeps me on my toes, and I cannot imagine a world without it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How or why did you begin using WordPress?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 23:40:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: Gallery Block Refactor Expected To Land in WordPress 5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121711\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:177:\"https://wptavern.com/gallery-block-refactor-expected-to-land-in-wordpress-5-9?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gallery-block-refactor-expected-to-land-in-wordpress-5-9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4838:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Last week, a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/25940\">GitHub pull request</a> I had been watching since October 2020 on the Gutenberg repository was finally merged into the codebase. It changes the structure of the WordPress Gallery block to be a container for nested Image blocks. The new format is expected to land in WordPress 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who want to begin testing it early, it should ship with Gutenberg 11.4 next week. However, you can <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/#nightly\">grab the nightly test version</a> from Gutenberg Times to see it in action now. To use the new Gallery format, you must enable it from the Gutenberg &gt; Experiments admin screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If you have ever added a custom link to an image block and then tried to do the same on a Gallery image, you will understand the frustration and confusion of not having consistency between different types of image blocks,&rdquo; wrote Glenn Davies in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/20/gallery-block-refactor-dev-note/\">refactor announcement post</a>. &ldquo;This inconsistency is because the core Gallery block stores the details of the included images as nested <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements within the block content. Therefore, the images within a gallery look and behave different from images within an individual image block.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the surface level, the Gallery block refactor does not change much for many users. They will still add images to galleries as they have for years. However, for more advanced usage, it opens a world of possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One oft-requested feature is the ability to add links to individual images in galleries. In the past, users could only link to attachment pages or the media file itself. Both options applied to all images. With the most recent change, users can modify each Image block, including customizing its link.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a link to an Image block within a Gallery.\n\n\n\n<p>While this allows for handling something as simple as links, there is so much more that users could do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a theme that I have been building, I have a custom Gallery block style that allows users to create a group of images with a Polaroid-style frame around them. It is something fun for folks who do not want the all-business-all-the-time look. Sometimes, I like to throw in a bit of whimsy.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Polaroid-style frame for galleries.\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with that block style is that it does not go far enough. For example, I also have Tilted Right and Tilted Left styles for individual Image blocks. However, users are unable to apply those within a Gallery. It would be easy to make those available to the entire set or randomize different &ldquo;tilt&rdquo; styles. However, the ideal method would be to control the design at the Image level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same is true for other options. Users could do something fun like add block styles and mix in custom colors, borders, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Colored Polaroid-style frames with different &ldquo;tilts.&rdquo;\n\n\n\n<p>There are other fun things users might be able to do, such as alternating square and rounded styles:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Alternating square and circle images.\n\n\n\n<p>The new structure may not be without some issues early on. WordPress will likely continue supporting the old format for a while for backward compatibility. All new Gallery blocks will be in the new. However, core should eventually automatically transform the old markup over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors who have added custom CSS will be those with the most potential work ahead. Attempting to support both the new and old markup could be an exercise in frustration. The new Gallery block has broken output with my custom theme &mdash; margins and widths are off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All styles for the new format begin with, at least, <code>.wp-block-gallery.blocks-gallery-grid.has-nested-images</code>. This will likely overrule custom theme styles. I have yet to figure out the obsession with chaining selectors in the core code. It creates a ton of code bloat and forces theme authors into a specificity battle. I am hoping this gets dialed back a bit. Either way, theme authors have plenty of time to test and implement any fixes if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long term, I am excited about the potential of breaking away from the idea of <em>just</em> adding images to galleries. For example, I would love to see a grid option for something like the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Gallery with quote.\n\n\n\n<p>Nesting a quote in the middle of my image gallery could be a fun block pattern idea that does not rely on a mishmash of stacked Column blocks.  We will see what the future holds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, turning Gallery blocks into containers is a welcome step.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 00:37:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 15: A Very WordPress Blooper\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=11146\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/08/episode-15-a-very-wordpress-blooper/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8883:\"<p>Ever wonder what it&#8217;s like behind the scenes of WP Briefing?

Normally I talk to you about WordPress and stuff, but I figured that we all need a little levity in our lives right now. So today&#8217;s episode is actually just a series of bloopers and mistakes that I&#8217;ve made while recording. When I was preparing for this podcast, no one mentioned the deep weirdness of standing alone in your closet talking to yourself, nor did they realize just how lost I can get in the surpassingly, lovely lyricism of a lilting line, and then just have no idea what I&#8217;m supposed to be reading in the script that I wrote for myself. So, my dear friends, I hope these bring you a little laugh. And if we&#8217;ve got any luck at all, you may also hear me singing to myself, my computer, or about how terrible my talking just was. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to a bonus briefing. I know I wasn&#8217;t going to sit boop, boop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I messed up the thing where I&#8217;m talking about how I mess up, of course. I&#8217;m going to do it one more time, and you can choose whatever is a reasonable thing there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we had such a lengthy WP Briefing, WordPress, I’m going to just start that over again. Sorry, everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friends. Oh, no. I don&#8217;t know how I end my own show. How do I end my own show? There we go. Sorry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a weird way to say that. I&#8217;m going to start over again from the transition. And then we&#8217;re just going to go straight through to the end. Maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The names that&#8230; I sound weird. I sound like I don&#8217;t know what my words are. And I said I wrote the words. I said I was all going to go in one go, and I&#8217;m a liar today. Okay, here we go. For realsies!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final first last take. Here we go. Sorry, I made myself laugh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg. And, and I, I&#8217;m also in that group. I don&#8217;t know why I said that like it was a surprise. I have me too. I&#8217;m also in there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugh, I ran out of air. For reasons, it was a short sentence. I don&#8217;t know why I ran out of air.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming out on April 14. That&#8217;s not true. It&#8217;s April 13. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the form below to share the. Pfft &#8211; what are the things!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is WP Briefing episode seven, no title because I don&#8217;t know what to call it because I gave it a title already. I gave it two titles, and then couldn&#8217;t remember why I gave it those titles. So I&#8217;ll come up with a title before we publish it. But I also have no idea what it is. I&#8217;m going to ask for help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing project since I have too many commas, and I really believed in my comma when I said it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to Gutenberg&#8230; pfft. Open source software like WordPress. I was going to smash that sentence into half a sentence. I was going to say when you know what you&#8217;re workussing on you have a solution which is not my friends of thing. So, I am just going to say the sentence again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was sitting over here wringing my hands for some reason during that entire list. And so if you can hear me wringing my hands, which would be a whole new height of anxiety for anyone, you let me know, and I will rerecord that also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a concept of. Nope, this is a lie. Get a concept of where to get your tickets is the silliest thing. I&#8217;m starting over from the small list of big things. Also, because I got too excited about how big my list is. I am going to get that excited again. But I will try not to shout about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Humming intro song&#8221; Dun dun dun dun dun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry, I had to scroll up, and I try not to scroll up when I&#8217;m talking in case maybe my whole computer turns into a microphone. Sorry, I&#8217;m just going to keep going because this has been a fine take so far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mercy! I have words that I can say with my mouth. They aren&#8217;t these words today. It seems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build up to&#8230; Oh my goodness. My stomach grumbled, and this microphone, I know,&nbsp; picked it up. And so I&#8217;m going to redo bullet two so that we don&#8217;t just have a small monster under the bed in the middle of the podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, like DEI, I feel s—Eh &#8211; maybe I should say, DEI, somewhere in there, so it&#8217;s clear for people cause I&#8217;m talking to people and not actually a screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I joined the WordPress project, the majority of my work with accessibility was in the context of the digital divide. Now, when talking about the digital divide, there are three concepts around quote-unquote, getting things to people. And those concepts are&#8230; I guess I could say the thing, hold on one second, I can do it. I feel like I&#8217;m chopping up my words like I&#8217;m not really breathing very well. So I apologize. But here we go again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t include that one. Sorry, I&#8217;m so nervous about this episode that, like, my mouth is getting dry, and I worry that you can hear it, and it drives me nuts every time I hear podcasters with a dry mouth, and you can just like hear it clicking and always stresses me out. I&#8217;m like, someone should give that poor thing a drink of water. And I just know I&#8217;m going to feel that way about myself later. And so I&#8217;m trying to stay hydrated, but it also means that I have to stop every two paragraphs and take a drink of water. I apologize for that interlude. I am about to start again, at my next section, which is like, halfway through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I learned that you can hear me swallowing my water with this microphone because it is a spectacular microphone. And so, I apologize for that as well. All right. Here I go. I&#8217;m going to do it all in one take. Watch me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have questions, especially about how to move everything forward. Mm-hmm. Whoops. I put especially in the wrong spot. But I also thought&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Ta da, we did it.

Where&#8217;s my where&#8217;s my turning offing button.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tada!

That gives me a license &mdash; not to be overused &mdash; to steer into hyperbole once in a while. I get to be critical, sometimes overly, because I can come back the next day and shower the WordPress project with praise. Perhaps, at times, I forget to be as fair or kind as I should be. Maybe I miss the mark when pointing out faults once in a while. I am sometimes simply wrong (as one reader <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/is-wordpress-development-really-all-that-hard-to-get-into-today#comment-390345\">recently pointed out</a>, that was the case with 90% of what I wrote). And, for those times that I do step out of bounds, I am sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it always comes from a genuine love of our community and loyalty to the WordPress mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had planned on writing about an upcoming feature change for WordPress today, but something more pressing came up. As I was working through that article, a new comment landed in my inbox for approval. It was on the borderline, that gray area where I had to determine whether it added enough value to the discussion. I felt like it needed a thoughtful reply and not the knee-jerk reaction I had initially written. It was gnawing at me because I knew few things could be further from the truth:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When Matias and Justin respond to comments and ask the commenters to supply more details about the problems they mentioned, I doubt many will do that, since many of us already know that the WordPress developers don&rsquo;t listen to us. They maybe pretend to listen, but the evidence shows that they do not. As one other commenter mentioned, we are suffering the tyranny of the minority.</p><cite><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-discussion-with-gutenberg-project-lead-matias-ventura-on-the-barrier-to-entry#comment-391573\">Christian Nelson</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It is disheartening when I see comments that state that the core contributors do not listen to users. However, I do understand where some of that sentiment may come from. There have been many pet features I have been passionate about that have never gotten the green light. Tickets that seemingly die out from lack of interest. Unresolved disagreements. It can become easy to think that you are shouting into the void.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is not because developers are not listening. That is not a fair statement to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my line of work, I follow nearly every aspect of the WordPress project. From Trac tickets to GitHub pull requests, from business acquisitions to theme development, I tend to dabble in a bit of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More often than not, I see others who care as deeply about the project as I do. I watch the core/inner developers &mdash; the folks who do the bulk of the work &mdash; gather and act upon as much feedback as possible. I see the same from people who are less in the public spotlight but just as vital to the community. Everything I see stands as overwhelming evidence that they listen. There is so much engagement on GitHub, Slack, and the Make blogs that I cannot keep up with it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mat&iacute;as Ventura, the Gutenberg project lead, has always been approachable and seems to care deeply about the project&rsquo;s success. I cannot recall ever reaching out to anyone working on WordPress who did not respond, even when I approached them outside of my role as a writer for WP Tavern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am amazed at how much time and energy Anne McCarthy puts into the FSE Outreach Program. Mostly, it is because I do not think I could do that job. For every complaint, criticism, or issue I have mentioned, she has dug up an existing ticket or filed a new one. She routinely does this for everyone who provides feedback on FSE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could list name after name after name of others who do the same, going above and beyond their typical roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I was reminded that we all &mdash; including myself &mdash; sometimes need to step back and evaluate how we view this project and the people who are working on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thousands of people contribute code, documentation, design mockups, translations, and much more. There are plugin authors who see a problem they want to solve. Developers who figure out how to do something and write a tutorial. This, still, is barely scratching the surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributing directly to the core project or being involved with the Make WordPress teams is often a thankless job. But, I am happy that so many are willing to bear the brunt of the criticism and continue working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everything we want will be implemented how or when we want it. Developers must balance each new feature or change against different, often conflicting, feedback. They do not always make the &ldquo;right&rdquo; call, but the best thing about software is that you can iterate upon it, bettering the platform from feedback on the earlier implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, WordPress simply needs more folks contributing to create a new feature or implement a change. Developers are only human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are all riding this ship together. We should strive to be kind and fair, avoiding blanket statements of the people who pour their hearts and souls into the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If nothing else, let&rsquo;s take folks at their word when they ask for more details about a problem.  That could very well be the first step in actually finding a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before stepping off my soapbox, I want to simply say one thing to those who contribute in any capacity to the WordPress project: thank you.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 00:51:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: Get Your Free Tickets to WordCamp US Online 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121549\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:161:\"https://wptavern.com/get-your-free-tickets-to-wordcamp-us-online-2021?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=get-your-free-tickets-to-wordcamp-us-online-2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3259:\"<p>WordCamp US 2021 will be held online this year on October 1.

Keith was selected for the committee last year, despite his well-documented criticisms of the AMP project. In his resignation email, he cites Google&rsquo;s control of the project and its small percentage of open source parts as reasons for his growing resentment:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I can&rsquo;t in good faith continue to advise on the AMP project for the OpenJS Foundation when it has become clear to me that AMP remains a Google product, with only a subset of pieces that could even be considered open source.</p><p>If I were to remain on the advisory committee, my feelings of resentment about this situation would inevitably affect my behaviour. So it&rsquo;s best for everyone if I step away now instead of descending into outright sabotage. It&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s me.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>During his time with the committee, Keith worked on defining what AMP is and pushing for clarification on whether the project encompasses more than just a collection of web components. The Google-controlled AMP cache and validation aspects of the project were the most concerning in evaluating his continued participation. Although the <a href=\"https://blog.amp.dev/2020/12/14/releasing-a-new-c-amp-validator/\">AMP Validator is open source</a>, the rules for validation are controlled by Google:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was hoping it was a marketing problem. We spent a lot of time on the advisory committee trying to figure out ways of making it clearer what AMP actually is. But it was a losing battle. The phrase &ldquo;the AMP project&rdquo; is used to cover up the deeply interwingled nature of its constituent parts. Bits of it are open source, but most of it is proprietary. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openjsf.org/\">OpenJS Foundation</a>&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good home for a mostly-proprietary project.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-project-joins-openjs-foundation\">AMP joined the OpenJS Foundation</a> in 2019, skeptics hailed the transfer as &ldquo;mostly meaningless window-dressing.&rdquo; What Keith witnessed during his time with the advisory committee lends credit to these early doubts about AMP being able to gain independence from Google:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Whenever a representative from Google showed up at an advisory committee meeting, it was clear that they viewed AMP as a Google product. I never got the impression that they planned to hand over control of the project to the OpenJS Foundation. Instead, they wanted to hear what people thought of&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;project. I&rsquo;m not comfortable doing that kind of unpaid labour for a large profitable organisation.</p><p>Even worse, Google representatives reminded us that AMP was being used as a foundational technology for other Google products:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amp.dev/about/stories/\">stories</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amp.dev/about/email/\">email</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amp.dev/about/ads/\">ads</a>, and even some weird payment thing in native Android apps. That&rsquo;s extremely worrying.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Keith&rsquo;s experience echoes some of the claims in the ongoing <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-under-fire-in-new-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google\">antitrust lawsuit against Google</a>, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other state attorneys general. The complaint states that the transfer of the AMP project to the OpenJS Foundation was superficial:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Although Google claims that AMP was developed as an open-source collaboration, AMP is actually a Google-controlled initiative. Google originally registered and still owns AMP&rsquo;s domain, ampproject.org. In addition, until the end of 2018, Google controlled all AMP decisionmaking. AMP relied on a governance model called &ldquo;Benevolent Dictator For Life&rdquo; that vested ultimate decision-making authority in a single Google engineer. Since then, Google has transferred control of AMP to a foundation, but the transfer was superficial. Google controls the foundation&rsquo;s board and debates internally [REDACTED].</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Keith was originally inspired by fellow dissenter Terence Eden to join the committee in hopes of making a difference. Eden eventually <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/12/i-have-resigned-from-the-google-amp-advisory-committee/\">resigned from the committee in December 2020</a>, after concluding that Google has limited interest in making AMP a better web citizen:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I do not think AMP, in its current implementation, helps make the web better,&rdquo; Eden said. &ldquo;I remain convinced that AMP is poorly implemented, hostile to the interests of both users and publishers, and a proprietary and unnecessary incursion into the open web.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three days after Keith&rsquo;s resignation, the foundation published a post titled, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://blog.amp.dev/2021/08/16/an-update-on-how-amp-is-served-at-the-openjs-foundation/\">An update on how AMP is served at the OpenJS Foundation</a>.&rdquo; The post seems to address Keith&rsquo;s impression that Google does not intend to hand over control of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When the AMP project&nbsp;moved&nbsp;to the OpenJS Foundation in 2019, our technical governance leaders shared a plan to separate the AMP runtime from the Google AMP Cache, and host the AMP runtime infrastructure at the vendor-neutral OpenJS Foundation,&rdquo; OpenJS Foundation Executive Director Robin Ginn said. &ldquo;OpenJS is happy to report that this complex task of re-architecting the AMP infrastructure is making tremendous progress thanks to input and guidance from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/meta-tsc\">AMP Technical Steering Committee</a>&nbsp;(TSC) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac\">AMP Advisory Committee</a>, as well as thanks to the AMP Project and OpenJS teams for coming together despite the work and life challenges that were sometimes faced during the pandemic.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement reiterated AMP&rsquo;s status as an open source project multiple times. Ginn did not elaborate on the &ldquo;tremendous progress&rdquo; but did announce a new development &ndash; the decision to be more hands-on in hosting AMP infrastructure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s new is that after disentangling the AMP runtime from the Google AMP Cache, the OpenJS Foundation will manage the servers that deliver the AMP runtime files (the download server and the CDN),&rdquo; Ginn said. &ldquo;As planned, the OpenJS Foundation has been involved in the implementation of hosting the CDN and has been spending additional time to fully understand the technical requirements.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OpenJS blog had not communicated any updates on the AMP project for nearly a year. While this post seems like a reaction to the news of Keith&rsquo;s resignation, it publicly confirms that the teams are still working on the infrastructure transfer. In the end, this may not be enough to convince critics that AMP is not simply a Google product with a fancy affiliation designed to make it more appealing to detractors. So far, the project&rsquo;s new home at the OpenJS Foundation has done little to bolster public opinion in the face of allegations that identify AMP as having an important role in Google&rsquo;s anti-competitive practices.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 17:07:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Second Annual WPMRR Virtual Summit To Kick Off September 21\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119705\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:183:\"https://wptavern.com/second-annual-wpmrr-virtual-summit-to-kick-off-september-21?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=second-annual-wpmrr-virtual-summit-to-kick-off-september-21\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6885:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WPMRR is gearing up for its second annual <a href=\"https://wpmrr.com/\">WPMRR Virtual Summit</a> after the success of last year&rsquo;s event. This year&rsquo;s online-only conference will run from September 21 &ndash; 23. WPMRR and WP Buffs founder Joe Howard is hosting the event alongside guest host Brian Richards, the organizer behind WordSesh and WooSesh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event is <a href=\"https://community.wpmrr.com/c/wpmrr-virtual-summit\">free to attend</a> for everyone. Even for those unable to make it, each session&rsquo;s recording will be available via the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6VCdggAmKs85oGLDAwgZ8w\">WP Buff&rsquo;s YouTube channel</a> at no cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPMRR and WP Buffs will be donating $1 per registrant and $1 per comment posted during all three summit days to <a href=\"https://www.lawyersforgoodgovernment.org/\">Lawyers for Good Government</a>, a non-profit organization of lawyers with a mission to fight for equal rights, opportunities, and justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A formal announcement of the speaker lineup and schedule is expected next week. As of now, all speakers are confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The WPMRR Virtual Summit is a three-day online conference that helps us fulfill our mission: to actively help as many people as possible responsibly achieve their MRR goals,&rdquo; said Howard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said the <a href=\"https://wpmrr.com/podcast/\">WPMRR Podcast</a> carries this mission forward by telling unfiltered stories of successful entrepreneurs. On the <a href=\"https://community.wpmrr.com/\">WPMRR Community</a> side, the goal is for members to grow their MRR together. The summit provides an onramp for newcomers into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like 2020, the event&rsquo;s talks and roundtables will be held over Vimeo Live. However, this year, they will be streamed directly into the <a href=\"https://community.wpmrr.com/c/wpmrr-virtual-summit\">WPMRR Virtual Community space</a>. The goal is to make it easier to transition attendees into becoming full-fledged community members, continuing their education and experience beyond a once-per-year event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The virtual summit will be a fantastic event, but often it&rsquo;s difficult for conferences to provide ongoing support, advice, and community to make sure what was learned at the event is actually implemented, tested, and integrated into attendees&rsquo; businesses,&rdquo; said Howard. &ldquo;This will make it far simpler to give direct access to our community to those who want to responsibly build their MRR alongside others all year round, not just for three days.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three-day event will be broken down as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>September 21: Sales &amp; Marketing</li><li>September 22: Operations &amp; Systems</li><li>September 23: Website Management</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The summit will use <a href=\"https://circle.so/\">Circle</a> to handle discussions via its commenting system. This should allow communication to happen at everyone&rsquo;s preferred pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our plans are to do a Q&amp;A, manage the &lsquo;Hallway,&rsquo; and provide a space for attendees, speakers and sponsors to all interact via asynchronous communication via the WPMRR Community,&rdquo; said Howard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>All About MRR</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">MRR is an acronym for Monthly Recurring Revenue. It is about generating repeated income every month instead of getting paid once for a product or service &mdash; a subscription-based model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Howard to break down why this concept is crucial for new or potential business owners in the WordPress space. He responded with several reasons for going this route over a one-time revenue model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re selling a product for $100 and want to make $100K in a year, you need to find 1,000 new customers to sign up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re selling something for $100/mo instead, you need far less because customers are paying you every month instead of just once. In most situations (especially because lead generation is a pain point for most businesses), delivering ongoing value to ~100 customers is far less work than finding 1,000 new customers!&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads to having multiple avenues to growing your business. With recurring revenue, entrepreneurs can continue attracting new customers and selling new features to existing ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howard also pointed out that subscriptions representing a chunk of total revenue creates a more predictable financial situation. This can lead to making easier budgeting decisions. Focusing on recurring revenue means constantly delivering value to customers instead of always chasing new sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Running a subscription business is way less stressful because the business model is simply more resilient,&rdquo; said Howard. &ldquo;If you rely on SEO to drive new leads to your business and Google penalizes you, your business will literally stop generating any revenue whatsoever if you only serve one-time customers. But if you have subscription revenue and this happens, you still have a collection of customers who pay you every month, giving you far more runway to figure out next steps before the business fails.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also asked Howard about the different levels of MRR and how the game changes as revenue increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Often, what gets you to $10K MRR evolves significantly if/when you&rsquo;re on your way to $83K MRR ($1M/year),&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is what makes the WPMRR Community so valuable, as we have different spaces folks can join based on what their MRR goals are.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also pointed out the crossover between those starting out and those running larger businesses, saying that it was important for both audiences to learn from the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We can listen to advice and best practices all day, but we don&rsquo;t know when inspiration will hit us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s important for those starting out to tune into some more advanced talks <em>and</em> for those running larger businesses to listen to beginners as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All our speakers will be instructed by Brian Richards (our day-of technical director and speaker preparer) to be really explicit about the context around any advice they&rsquo;re giving and how it could apply to businesses of different sizes and scales. That way, we can help people at whatever stage they&rsquo;re at!&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://community.wpmrr.com/c/wpmrr-virtual-summit/behind-the-scenes\">entire written interview</a> with Howard is available via the WPMRR Community site. It is worth reading for those who want to learn more about the event and MRR from his experience or an unfiltered version of this story.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 00:21:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 21) — Dealing With Developer Overload: Focus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=85220\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://poststatus.com/excerpt/21/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3290:\"<h2 id=\"h-avoiding-ego-reinventing-the-wheel-and-shiny-objects\">Avoiding ego, reinventing the wheel, and shiny objects.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In this episode, David and Cory discuss <strong>Developer Overload</strong>, which David defines as what happens when &#8220;when you receive too much information and are unable to process it, resulting in negative responses and unhealthy effects.&#8221; David shares tips on how developers can focus on what to pay serious attention to, how to avoid creating more work for themselves, how to increase focus, and what project managers can do to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also covered in this episode: </strong>&#8220;As developers, we often bite off more than we can chew&#8230; we also tend to take that bite from the wrong side of the sandwich.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\">Every week Post Status Excerpt will brief you on important WordPress news — in about 15 minutes or less!

The Button block now supports the padding control, and the Post Featured Image block has new width and height settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the release&rsquo;s highlights was a speed improvement for both opening and searching within the inserter. The opening time dropped over 200 ms, from 370.35 ms to 137.28 ms. Search speed went from 190.37 ms to 67.24 ms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest release includes a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33714\">simplified color picker</a> library. Rich previews for links, a feature introduced in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-9-renames-the-query-block-adds-collapsible-list-view-items-and-rolls-out-rich-url-previews\">Gutenberg 10.9</a> for external URLs, now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33086\">works with internal site links</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors should enjoy the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32659\">reduced specificity</a> of the reset and classic editor stylesheets. Such changes always make it a little easier for theme authors to match editor and front-end styling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dimension Panel for Spacing Controls</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Toggling the padding and margin controls for the Site Tagline block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 11.3 introduces a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32392\">Dimensions panel</a> for blocks that support either margin or padding controls. The feature adds an ellipsis (<code>...</code>) button in place of the typical open/close tab arrow. Users can select which controls they want to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The long-term goal is to clean up the interface, only exposing controls that a user actually needs. Because such needs are subjective, allowing users to toggle them on/off is an ideal route to take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current downsides are twofold. Once choosing to display margin or padding controls, the panel itself cannot be collapsed. This exacerbates the very problem that the new feature attempts to solve &mdash; decluttering the sidebar interface. For me, at least, I always want quick access to spacing controls. However, I do not always need them shown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second issue is that the user choice of what to display does not seem to be stored. Each time you work with a block, you must select which controls should appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Dimensions panel is only <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/28356\">one part of the process</a> of wrangling sizing (width and height), spacing (padding and margin), and related controls for blocks. Work toward a more well-rounded solution is still underway. Presumably, the development team will address these issues and others in future releases. However, those who run the Gutenberg plugin in production should expect oddities with usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/from-ecommerce-integration-to-location-based-controls-block-visibility-pro-expands-upon-its-free-version\">Block Visibility plugin</a> has the most user-friendly version of such a toggle control right now. It is not yet a perfect solution, but it works a little better than what is currently in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Button Block Padding</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Testing the new Button block padding option with TT1 Blocks.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It is no secret that I dislike the default padding of the Button block when using the TT1 Blocks theme (block-based version of Twenty Twenty-One). I have made it one of my missions to routinely point it out, even going so far as refusing to use the block in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-9-building-a-higher-ed-header\">last call for testing</a> as part of the FSE Outreach Program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An oversized button is not always the wrong stylistic choice on a webpage. Context matters and I somehow continue to run into scenarios where I need something a bit more scaled back. Control over the Button block&rsquo;s padding has been on my wish list for months, and the Gutenberg development team delivered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of 11.3, users can control the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31774\">padding of individual Button</a> blocks. It will now appear as an option within the new Dimensions panel mentioned earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Prayer answered.</em> Now, let us move toward adding padding controls to all the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one potential issue some users might run into is maintaining consistent spacing when using multiple Button blocks together. The easiest way to do this is to add and style the first, then duplicate it to create others with the same spacing. This is not a new issue; it applies to all Button options where users want consistency within a group.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Featured Image Dimension Controls</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adjusting a Post Featured Image block&rsquo;s dimensions.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Post Featured Image block has finally received a small but handy upgrade. In the past, users and theme authors only had a single option of deciding whether to link it to the post. Now, they can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27620\">control the width and height</a> of the image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a user sets a height for the image, the editor will reveal a separate &ldquo;Scale&rdquo; option with the following choices:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cover (default)</li><li>Contain</li><li>Stretch</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What do these options actually do?</em> That would be a good question. Even as someone in the web design and development loop for close to two decades, I sometimes forget and must look them up. They are values for the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit\"><code>object-fit</code> CSS property</a> and are likely to confuse users in many instances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cover and contain allow the image to fit within the containing element&rsquo;s box while maintaining its aspect ratio (no stretching the image). The difference is that the cover value will be clipped if it does not fit and the contain value may be letterboxed. A stretch value will fill its container regardless of the aspect ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the image&rsquo;s aspect ratio on its container, each of the values could essentially display the same thing on the screen. Or, they could provide wildly different results. Coupling these dimensions controls with wide and full alignments (also width-related options) could make for some unpredictable experiments too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme designer in me wants to disable the UI for this altogether and present something slightly more controlled: an image size selector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a selector should not be confused with width and height controls. WordPress theme authors have been registering custom image sizes for years. The primary use case for this was featured images. Users can use these sizes with the current Image and Latest Posts blocks. However, they do not yet have this option with Post Featured Image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am in the camp that believes image size controls should have been the first addition to the block. It is such an integral part of WordPress theme design that it cannot be left out, and I have <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27620#issuecomment-851016057\">been fighting</a> &mdash; <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27620#issuecomment-890265808\">or at least nagging</a> &mdash; to make sure that theme authors can control featured images via custom sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there is an open ticket for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33789\">custom image size support</a>. Among other still-missing features, it is a blocker for many theme authors looking to take the leap toward block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of use cases for the new options, such as automatically cropping a post grid&rsquo;s featured images to a square.

Although that restriction was put into place approximately <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/10633\">seven months ago</a>, there was no official communication on the change.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://twitter.com/YoungbloodJoe/status/1426319260796833792\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the result of the controversy gaining attention on social media and other channels, WordPress Plugin Team member Mika Epstein <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5591#comment:3\">posted</a> an explanation on the original meta trac ticket, the reasoning for how and why &ldquo;wp&rdquo; is being blocked:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Using wp- at the beginning of plugin permalinks, yes. Due to how we built this out, the display name is what gets checked and flagged. You can use WPPluginName (no space) and Plugin Name for WP.</p><p>This stems from part of a longer conversation going on with the Foundation, regarding handling the actual misuse of &lsquo;WordPress&rsquo; in plugin names (which, as we all know, is actually trademarked and as such should not be used in your plugin name at all).</p><p>Because using WP Blah Blah as a name tends to lead to people changing it after approval to &ldquo;WordPress Blah Blah&rdquo; we put a pause on it to try and get a handle on how bad is this, what&rsquo;s the depth of the problem (vs the actual headache of WC -&gt; WooCommerce in names) and so on.</p><p>There is also the reality that using &lsquo;WP&rsquo; or &lsquo;Plugin&rsquo; in a plugin permalink is unnecessary and can be harmful to SEO due to repetitive words.</p><p>No one is claiming WP is trademarked, we&rsquo;re just trying to minimize confusion and prevent people from accidentally violating trademarks in the future because they change WP to WordPress later on.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether or not &ldquo;wp&rdquo; was trademarked became a particular point of confusion because the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/10633\">commit message</a> on the change said: &ldquo;Adding in some more things to block based on use and trademarks.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation with the <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/\">WordPress Foundation</a> that Epstein was referencing was a private discussion about how the team can mitigate trademark abuse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This came up in the midst of an ad hoc brainstorm about the ways that the loophole could be more effectively managed, and so there wasn&rsquo;t a lengthy public discussion on it,&rdquo; WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It was part of an experiment for handling that loophole more effectively and wasn&rsquo;t meant to be permanent. The great thing about experiments in WordPress is that when we see that we&rsquo;re throwing out the good along with the bad, we can make&nbsp;the necessary changes to do it better.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haden Chomphosy said that although the original discussion was private, the team plans to make it public via the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5868\">new meta ticket</a> that was opened yesterday for improving the checks on plugin submissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All future discussions will be on the ticket, so as people work on it, then the conversations will be available there,&rdquo; she said when asked how the trademark abuse mitigation experiment will be evaluated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Foundation does not have any employees, but Haden Chomphosy said the representatives who can help with the grey areas of trademark guidelines include herself, Andrea Middleton, and Cami Kaos.&nbsp;She also confirmed that &ldquo;WP&rdquo; is not a WordPress trademark and the Foundation is not pursuing trademarking the term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although each of these individuals referenced have a long track record of protective care for the WordPress community and have demonstrated a sincere desire to see the project grow, they are all employed by Automattic. The Foundation could use some outside representation if those running it are engaging in private decision making and giving directives to the WordPress.org Plugin Team that have significant ramifications for the ecosystem as a whole. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, the WordPress community has been encouraged to use WP instead of WordPress in plugin names, so the decision to reject plugins with WP in the name is a major, controversial change. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem for me is 1. you are penalizing everyone for something a few people do. 2. it doesn\'t actually fix the problem because I could change any of my plugin names to WordPress after the fact and 3. There\'s NO official announcement explaining this.</p>&mdash; Brad Williams (@williamsba) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsba/status/1427726874835365893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who oppose the current experiment have pointed out that it unfairly penalizes everyone for the few who change their plugin names after approval. It polices potential misuse instead of providing a solution that can flag actual trademark abuse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some plugin developers have noted that having WP in the plugin name is necessary to differentiate it from extensions for other platforms, since WordPress.org is not the only place where their products are distributed. Many successful businesses have been created on top of plugins with WP as a prefix in the name, such as WP Mail SMTP, WP Fastest Cache, WP Migrate DB, to name just a few. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it is beneficial or detrimental to use WP in a brand&rsquo;s name is immaterial to the discussion at hand. With the current trademark abuse mitigation experiment in place, all new plugin developers hoping to use the WP prefix will have their plugins rejected.  Fortunately it isn&rsquo;t retroactive, but if the team decides the experiment of banning WP in plugin names is a success, it may be up for discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Springing experiments on the community without publicly communicating the intent is a misstep for the Foundation. If allowing WP in the name creates wrong expectations for plugin developers regarding their ability to change the name to use WordPress, then the problem needs to be fixed at the root. WordPress.org needs to find a better way to inform developers about which terms are actually trademarked and develop a technical solution to flag name changes that do not comply. This may be a difficult technical problem to solve regarding plugin submission and updates, but it&rsquo;s worth investing in it to respect plugin authors&rsquo; freedoms.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 17:32:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 9.1.1 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=320593\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://buddypress.org/2021/08/buddypress-9-1-1-security-and-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3466:\"<p>BuddyPress 9.1.1 is now available.

The article followed a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisWiegman/status/1420068080944885767\">tweet</a> and <a href=\"https://chriswiegman.com/2021/08/the-changing-wordpress-ecosystem/\">post</a> by Chris Wiegman that stated the current learning curve was extremely high, regardless of past experience. Members of the community responded with a flurry of articles, podcasts, and videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because modern WordPress is primarily centered on Gutenberg, I reached out to the project&rsquo;s lead, Mat&iacute;as Ventura. The goal was to bring some balance to the discussion. Unfortunately, he could not get back to me until a few days after the story was published. However, given his unique insight and perspective on the project, his views should be shared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our discussion, we covered the topic of the barrier to entry from multiple viewpoints. Depending on where a specific developer, designer, or user steps onto the ramp, each will have a different experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Are We Having the Same Discussions?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The block editor shipped with WordPress 5.0 in December 2018. We are closing in on three years, but it often feels like we are having the same discussions. One has to wonder why we have not yet moved beyond that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think this is a case of the size of the WordPress community, its diversity of perspectives, and the fact that we do still have a lot of work to do to continue to make things accessible,&rdquo; said Ventura. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen people that start with no prior WP knowledge get flying super quickly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He recounted one story of a popular block library that launched last year. The creators were designers but did not recognize themselves as developers. However, the APIs allowed them to build an entire plugin that would not have been possible with their previous skillset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;To me, this was a triumph of the block APIs that are available for builders,&rdquo; said Ventura. &ldquo;But this is just one person&rsquo;s perspective. It doesn&rsquo;t invalidate PHP developers expressing frustration at the complexities of modern front-end tools.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Theme Creation and New Onramps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On the theme creation front, we were in agreement. There are new ways (and more on the way) for non-developers to ease into visually building various parts of a website without needing the entire weight of theme development knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura began his WordPress journey with theme development after first being exposed to Flash in the early 2000s. He recalled downloading a bunch of PHP files and thought he could execute by opening them. It is safe to say that he has learned a lot since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Being able to edit pieces of a theme is a crucial aspect of democratizing access to code,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think we are going to be seeing a lot of people get started by diving into how templates work. Or by playing with the Query block, which used to be a hidden piece unless you knew a bit of PHP already.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He mentioned that, in some ways, this aspect of the block editor allowed solo creators or small teams to build unique projects, pointing to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-second-look-at-elmastudios-aino-theme-and-companion-block-plugin\">Aino</a> as an example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeing a ton of designers for whom contributing to WordPress was difficult or a gated experience,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of developer entitlement when we say things used to be easy. They were not easy for a large chunk of the population that might have been excellent contributors if there were more avenues to contribute.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">Patterns</a> may be the first official stepping stone, one avenue among many that WordPress could facilitate in the future. Ventura envisions a possible .ORG-hosted visual theme builder that would allow users to create and publish without ever touching code. We are likely years from seeing such a project come to fruition, but lofty goals can lead to innovative ideas that we have yet to think of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building Block Plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Block plugins are a different beast than themes. The barrier is undoubtedly higher, but how big is this hurdle for traditional WordPress developers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Going from contributing a pattern to building a block is a big leap right now,&rdquo; said Ventura. &ldquo;While there are folks that can learn it quickly, it&rsquo;s still a big barrier for people. I think there are several layers to this: documentation could be an order of magnitude better in both organization and presentation. I hope we can do a lot more there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is also curious about tools for building blocks, such as a blend of <a href=\"https://youknowriad.github.io/blockbook/\">BlockBook</a> and <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>. He mulled over the possibility of blocks used for creating other blocks, a scenario in which developers might only need to write HTML with the tool interpreting features like Rich Text fields. At the very least, he believes we are barely scratching the surface of what the block-building experience could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The biggest challenge is that there&rsquo;s a tendency in PHP trained folks to neglect a bit the implications on the UX if it means the developer experience is simpler,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think this is most visible in the shortcode/forms approach to UX as opposed to direct manipulation, which is hard to codify from a PHP set of APIs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress/Gutenberg Contribution and the Bus Factor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Outside of building themes or plugins, the third and arguably the highest level of participating in the WordPress development ecosystem is direct contributions to the block system. Is contributing to core harder today than it was just a few years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think this is a good point, but I think it partially misses that contributing to WP internals like <code>WP_Query</code> was also very difficult,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We just got used to it. We have received more contributions to Gutenberg from people than what I have seen in Trac in my years there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura did admit that GitHub could be a factor in the amount of contribution, which many developers tend to favor over Trac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While building an editor is a difficult task and requires certain levels of expertise, other parts of the system, such as the component library or smaller packages, might offer alternative paths for some people to get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Apart from this, I do agree that there&rsquo;s also a higher level of expectations for what software should be capable of doing these days that make contributing meaningfully a harder task than before,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, other parts of WordPress that relied on the JavaScript model, such as the media library, have not had high levels of contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this is a topic we&rsquo;ll exhaust any time soon, and it&rsquo;s important to not become complacent and just say &lsquo;oh things are just hard&rsquo; because an important part of the WP project being open source is that users can modify said software, and for that, they need to understand it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think we can introduce a new generation of people to coding if we do things right and work together more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secondary aspect of this is whether there is a bus factor for WordPress. If so, what is the number? This is a common question around the most technically challenging pieces of software. If X number of contributors with the requisite knowledge of the most complex pieces of a project were hit by a bus (sorry for the grim imagery), would the development grind to a halt?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not something often discussed in WordPress circles because it has never seemed to be an issue. However, if contributing to core carries too high of a barrier to entry, is there a number where the project cannot continue?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think, in some ways, it&rsquo;s more sustainable now,&rdquo; said Ventura. &ldquo;We have been a lot more open with contribution permissions on the Gutenberg repo, and it has resulted in a larger amount of folks contributing. I think we might see a split between contributors that are comfortable with the back-end side of WP and those that are more comfortable with the interactive pieces.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing the team did not entirely anticipate was Gutenberg&rsquo;s use in projects outside of WordPress. This can add to its sustainability factor. He pointed to the WordPress mobile app being an example where others can meaningfully contribute. And other mobile apps are wanting to use it for their tools. At Automattic, where Ventura is employed, they are also working on adopting editor technologies for Tumblr.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think a broader topic of discussion, in general, is that contributing meaningfully to WP has become the privilege of those sponsored to work on it full time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s in some ways natural but also a bit of a tragedy.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 23:20:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: New Boilerplate Speeds Up Building “Nearly Headless” WordPress Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121528\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:199:\"https://wptavern.com/new-boilerplate-speeds-up-building-nearly-headless-wordpress-themes?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-boilerplate-speeds-up-building-nearly-headless-wordpress-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7178:\"<p>Alex Standiford, a WordPress developer at AffiliateWP, has released a boilerplate for what he is calling a <a href=\"https://github.com/nicholas-wordpress/nearly-headless-theme\">&ldquo;nearly headless&rdquo; WordPress theme</a>. It uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/alexstandiford/underpin\">Underpin</a>&nbsp;,<a href=\"https://github.com/nicholas-wordpress\">Nicholas</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/\">AlpineJS</a> to provide an app-like experience for a website while providing the flexibility for rendering specific pages using PHP instead of Javascript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.wpdev.academy/concepts/headless-wordpress-is-overrated-a-case-for-the-nearly-headless-web-app/\">Headless WordPress is Overrated: A Case for The Nearly-Headless Web App</a>,&rdquo; Standiford describes a few of the drawbacks of going fully headless.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>One problem with fully-headless WordPress is routing. Behind the scenes, WordPress has a lot of logic built-in to handle routing, and with a headless approach you have to build something to handle that on the front end. Ultimately, you&rsquo;re re-inventing the wheel, and it takes a lot of extra time to build.</p><p>Another problem with headless WordPress quickly becomes apparent the moment you try to use most WordPress plugins. The ugly truth is that you usually have to re-invent a lot of things just to get the plugin working properly.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Standiford&rsquo;s nearly headless system is a product of his rethinking headless WordPress. He wanted to preserve the app-like feel as well as all of WordPress&rsquo; built in capabilities and those available through the plugin system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nearly Headless WordPress theme uses AlpineJS for rendering, which Standiford says is light, easy-to-understand, and &ldquo;<span>plays exceptionally nice with PHP server-side rendering</span>.&rdquo; It is loaded around HTML template tags that source post content using WordPress&rsquo; REST API. The system uses session storage to keep things speedy and minimize the number of REST API calls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standiford&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://wpdev.academy\">WP Dev Academy</a> learning site and his agency, <a href=\"https://designframesolutions.com/\">DesignFrame Solutions</a>, are both using beta versions of the nearly headless system. Since the time those sites were developed, Standiford has completely rewritten the system and made significant improvements based on what from what he learned from earlier versions. He has a live demo of the current version available at <a href=\"https://nearly-headless.dev/\">nearly-headless.dev</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DFS_Web?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DFS_Web</a>&rsquo;s website redesign will make it possible to visit any page without an internet connection shortly after the first page is loaded. This makes this site FAST even if your internet connection is slow. <a href=\"https://t.co/keOxyMU8cq\">pic.twitter.com/keOxyMU8cq</a></p>&mdash; Alex Standiford (@AlexStandiford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexStandiford/status/1336468966160683017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 9, 2020</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The nearly headless approach is comparable to a traditional headless approach in terms of performance, thanks to Standiford&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/nicholas-wordpress/app\">Nicholas library</a>, which includes client-side caching and a routing layer as the application support for the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Nicholas will load content via REST, much like how a headless site does,&rdquo; Standiford said. &ldquo;In these cases, the load times are very similar to what you&rsquo;d see on a headless site. In fact, they behave, and fundamentally work in the same manner. The key is Nicholas also stores the data in session storage after the page is visited, and any time that page is loaded thereafter, it is loaded instantly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How far can the boilerplate take you? Developers who use it should be ready to extend or replace the basic templates it includes to load WordPress. It doesn&rsquo;t enqueue any CSS. Key functionality is broken into separate dependencies so users can stay up to date as the project evolves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;For all intents and purposes, the boilerplate is a blank slate,&rdquo; Standiford said. &ldquo;You can think of the boilerplate as _s for the nearly headless approach. All of the dependencies, scripts, and items needed to run the engine are included in the boilerplate. All of the dependencies are packaged up in Composer or Node, so your theme can be updated as the system improves without re-writing your entire theme.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standiford has some major improvements planned for the future of the boilerplate. It is currently compatible with the block editor and many plugins but requires a compatibility mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The big up-front improvement is going to be removing the need for compatibility mode on as many pages as possible,&rdquo; Standiford said. &ldquo;Many block libraries, forms plugins, and other things have specific scripts that they expect are loaded on the page that the app has no way to know about, and because of this, some plugins won&rsquo;t work without turning on compatibility mode. It <em>is</em> possible to make these work, but I would benefit from help from plugin developers to help me understand what styles/scripts need to be included when the app runs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standiford said he sees an opportunity to create npm packages that integrate other plugins, and ensure they work as expected. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yoast and other SEO plugins for example set the SEO information in the head of each page, and right now that doesn&rsquo;t happen without writing another piece of middleware,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too difficult to add it, but it&rsquo;s one of those things that could be packaged up and included instead of manually being written for every theme that uses this approach.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another item on the Nearly Headless WordPress theme boilerplate roadmap is improvements to how dependencies are compiled to better avoid plugin and theme conflicts. Standiford thinks this would make it easier to distribute themes built using this method on the WordPress.org directory, or even to sell them commercially. He has also been experimenting with automatically caching all the content on a page when it loads, without bogging down the browser or overloading the server with requests. The result would be instantaneous page loads with reduced server loads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/nicholas-wordpress/nearly-headless-theme\">Boilerplate for Nearly Headless WordPress Themes</a> is available on GitHub and Standiford is also <a href=\"https://www.wpdev.academy/concepts/headless-wordpress-is-overrated-a-case-for-the-nearly-headless-web-app/\">creating a course</a> that will help developers build sites using this nearly headless paradigm. He anticipates it will be released in November 2021.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 22:00:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: A Second Look at ElmaStudio’s Aino Theme and Companion Block Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121513\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:197:\"https://wptavern.com/a-second-look-at-elmastudios-aino-theme-and-companion-block-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-second-look-at-elmastudios-aino-theme-and-companion-block-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6980:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I am about a month away from my second anniversary writing for WP Tavern. There has been one project that I have followed since the beginning of this journey. In some ways, we are learning the ropes and growing in this block-based WordPress era together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, just before taking on this role, one of the first story notes I jotted down was some thoughts on ElmaStudio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/aino-blocks/\">Aino Blocks plugin</a>. However, it was not until nearly a year later when the team took the project out of beta testing, and I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/one-year-after-beta-elmastudios-aino-blocks-plugin-lands-in-the-plugin-directory\">followed up with a review</a> of the flagship <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/aino/\">Aino theme</a> and plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it is fortuitous that the team recently <a href=\"https://wpaino.com/blog/aino-2-0-theme-update-guide/\">released version 2.0</a> of its theme at just about the same time I started taking stock of my time at the Tavern. Maybe this is fate&rsquo;s way of telling me that we should always have a yearly update on Aino &mdash; <em>sound like a good idea?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also did not hurt that Mat&iacute;as Ventura, the Gutenberg project lead, name-dropped their work in a conversation we had last week. &ldquo;It fills me with joy when I see initiatives like [Aino] built by just a couple folks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Apart from the user aspects of our work, it&rsquo;s what makes it all worth it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was part of a more in-depth discussion related to the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/is-wordpress-development-really-all-that-hard-to-get-into-today\">barriers to entry in the modern WordPress era</a>. We agreed that one of the easier onramps was theme creation and site design, a focus area for Aino.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was time to dive back into the project. I had not looked into it deeply enough since my last review a year ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, at the time, I had mixed feelings about it. I initially thought the plugin launched too late. It seemed to be <em>yet another block library</em> after larger companies beat them to the punch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer, who co-owns the company alongside Manuel Esposito, encouraged me to check back in as they continued building. They were merely setting the stage for their vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We wanted to release the Aino blocks and theme on WordPress.org since they are stable to use right now,&rdquo; she <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/one-year-after-beta-elmastudios-aino-blocks-plugin-lands-in-the-plugin-directory#comment-340431\">wrote in the comments</a>. &ldquo;But the actual work is just starting for us, since we are now creating block patterns for our system, and I think it is only then that users will see why we built the theme and blocks in a certain way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Year Later</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />One of multiple feature patterns from the Aino theme.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The ElmaStudio team is taking that leap that most theme companies will inevitably need to take. They announced that Aino 2.0 ditched its classic garb and moved to 100% blocks earlier this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this particular theme, the move was not as monumental as it would be for others with more intricate layouts. Aino itself was always a minimal design, more of an open canvas for blocks than anything. It is the sort of theme meant to get out of the way and allow the user to create individual pages from the ground up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That may have been its downside a year ago. The team had built a plugin for easing users into the page-building process, but its single block pattern did not provide much of a starting point. Its Grid block is a powerful tool but also feels like it is catered more toward designers/developers. Its options may be too advanced to some end-users depending on their familiarity with CSS terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, this looks much different. The Aino theme comes with &mdash; <em>count &rsquo;em</em> &mdash; 42 <a href=\"https://wpaino.com/patterns/\">block patterns</a>. It is also where this project shines. I <em>may</em> have mentioned something about this being the route to go last year:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The company&rsquo;s best bet is to focus on building patterns. Its first pattern shows some promise. I am holding out hope for more interesting work to come.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The team took that dev-friendly base of the Grid block and built a system of easy-to-use layouts on top of it. Users merely need to click to insert and customize.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Aino&rsquo;s Grid block used in a portfolio pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Because Aino&rsquo;s patterns are built upon this grid foundation, the design studio&rsquo;s layouts are fine-tuned for each screen size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless other theme authors build on top of the same plugin or a similar grid-based block, they are left with stock WordPress/Gutenberg. This provides limited options for responsively designing more complex layouts. This should be a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/early-wordpress-5-9-look-the-road-toward-deeper-responsive-block-design\">focal point of the WordPress 5.9 release cycle</a>, but it could be a while before we have something as powerful as the various grid blocks available via plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ElmaStudio&rsquo;s groundwork in the previous two years is bearing fruit, at least in terms of what the team can create. With the foundational elements in place, nothing should stop them from building the next 42 patterns and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />A team pattern from the Aino theme (also built on the Grid block).\n\n\n\n<p>I am still lukewarm about most of the blocks in the plugin, think the Hero and Testimonial blocks should just be patterns, and the [Aino] Buttons block should be an options extension for the one in core. The Grid layout is the feature that all the best things about the Aino project hinge on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Aino theme itself seems unimpressive on its own, at least at first glance. However, the project is not whole until it is coupled with the Aino Blocks plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme needs some design work on its default spacing. For example, paragraphs that follow a wide or full-aligned block have no gap above them. Blockquote text butts against the side of the left border. Trivial bugs like these are easy fixes. Sometimes, it is not evident that there is an issue until a Gutenberg plugin update, which often leaves theme authors chasing changes. Such is the life of a designer living on the bleeding edge, supporting the latest features via a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am happy I once again had the opportunity to dive back into the Aino project. A year makes a difference, and the duo behind the theme and plugin has made use of the time. Right now, they have a solid project for users who want to build out their pages with blocks. There are enough patterns for just about any website owner.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 22:09:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"Matt: Funding, Buyback, and Hiring\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=54656\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2021/08/funding-buyback-hiring/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4763:\"<p>In February of this year, <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> closed a new primary funding round of $288M, bringing in some great new partners including BlackRock, Wellington, Schonfeld, and Alta Park. Existing investors ICONIQ and Aglaé (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Arnault\">Bernard Arnault</a>) also participated. This round was common stock, and like all funding since 2011, included a proxy assigning me the right to vote the shares.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic was very busy during this time frame, as we were working on what would become the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2021/02/parse-ly-automattic/\">Parse.ly</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2021/06/day-one-at-automattic/\">Day One</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/07/16/popular-podcast-app-pocket-casts-joins-automattic/\">Pocket Casts</a> acquisitions, our investments <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/element-a-messaging-app-built-on-the-decentralized-matrix-protocol-raises-30m/\">in Element</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/automattic-values-business-email-startup-titan-at-300-million?sref=tT7Af65V\">Titan</a>, plus more acquisitions and partnerships we haven&#8217;t announced yet, so we haven’t mentioned the February funding round until now. And while we are a bit surprised the fundraise did not leak to the press, it&#8217;s now been an awkwardly long time since February and I&#8217;m pleased to formally announce it now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since then, Automattic has continued to grow at a rapid pace and we recently took the opportunity to do a $250M share buyback at a $7.5B valuation that just closed last week. The buyback was primarily targeted at current and former employees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve grown and increased our valuation at a rate higher than most other alternate investments available to investors. However, some of Automattic’s employees and former employee shareholders have been part of our journey for a very long time. Selling a bit of their equity holdings could have a significant impact on their lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic was founded 16 years ago and is still private, so it&#8217;s important for us to try to provide liquidity to any shareholder who wants it. We do the same with our internal A12 stock plan where we let our employees buy our shares and also offer an opportunity for all holders to sell them back to Automattic, every quarter.&nbsp;(I need to do a longer post on that.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting thing we&#8217;ve been doing in these buybacks is holding the shares as treasury stock within the company instead of canceling the shares at purchase. This allows us to buy shares that come onto the market, and then when an investor comes and wants to put a larger quantum of capital into the company, we can re-sell the treasury shares that the company bought earlier. In effect, we are providing both a sell-side and buy-side for Automattic stock, serving previous and new investors and making money on these trades since we bought and took the risk earlier. We’ve established a logical valuation methodology, which is based on a simple multiple of the last twelve month&#8217;s revenue, so shareholders can track and anticipate performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this has been a lot of fun and we’ve seen a great amount of success, but it&#8217;s not all smooth sailing; we still have our share of challenges, probably the biggest being hiring. We have significantly scaled up our ability to find and hire great folks, with 371 accepted offers already in 2021 and it&#8217;s only August.

There isn&#8217;t a good answer yet, and many developers mostly develop dynamic blocks, rendered in PHP consistently no matter when the block was added to a post. If a new version is available, it&#8217;ll get the new design/styling. Or skip native block development altogether and rely on Blocks created via Advanced Custom Fields Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dynamic block was my first block, too, and I haven&#8217;t had the time to experiment with JavaScript blocks and the versioning for static blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/is-wordpress-development-really-all-that-hard-to-get-into-today\"><strong>Is WordPress Development Really All That Hard To Get Into Today?</strong></a> Asked <strong>Justin Tadlock </strong>in his opinion post on the WordPress Tavern, that collected over 40 comments from the site&#8217;s Community, many share great resources to get over initial hurdles, too. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Don&#8217;t want to miss the next Weekend Edition? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<form class=\"wp-block-newsletterglue-form ngl-form ngl-portrait\" action=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/\" method=\"post\"><div class=\"ngl-form-container\"><div class=\"ngl-form-field\"><label class=\"ngl-form-label\" for=\"ngl_email\">Type in your Email address to subscribe.</label><div class=\"ngl-form-input\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"ngl-form-input-text\" name=\"ngl_email\" id=\"ngl_email\" /></div></div><button class=\"ngl-form-button\">Subscribe</button><p class=\"ngl-form-text\">We hate spam, too and won&#8217;t give your email address to anyone except Mailchimp to send out our Weekend Edition</p></div><div class=\"ngl-message-overlay\"><div class=\"ngl-message-svg-wrap\"></div><div class=\"ngl-message-overlay-text\">Thanks for subscribing.</div></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ngl_list_id\" id=\"ngl_list_id\" value=\"26f81bd8ae\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ngl_double_optin\" id=\"ngl_double_optin\" value=\"yes\" /></form>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 16:25:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Early WordPress 5.9 Look: The Road Toward Deeper Responsive Block Design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121486\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:207:\"https://wptavern.com/early-wordpress-5-9-look-the-road-toward-deeper-responsive-block-design?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=early-wordpress-5-9-look-the-road-toward-deeper-responsive-block-design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6231:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg project lead Mat&iacute;as Ventura announced the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/13/preliminary-road-to-5-9/\">Preliminary Road to 5.9</a> on the Make Core blog earlier today. He covered several <em>big picture</em> items, including several sub-points for each. He also linked to a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33094\">GitHub issue </a>with specific tasks and tickets that need work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post covers notes on block patterns, navigation menus, the <code>theme.json</code> interface (global styles), design tools, and editing flows for block themes. There is a lot of information to take in and enough areas to cover various interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting focus of 5.9 might just be going deeper into responsive design at the block level, whether this is under-the-hood code or block options available via the UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest points of friction for pattern and theme builders are the lack of responsive tools available at a block level,&rdquo; wrote Ventura. &ldquo;This needs to be solved in a way that doesn&rsquo;t disproportionally increase interface complexity.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Intrinsic Web Design With Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Mobile design patterns shared by Ventura.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It is easy to become disgruntled at the slow progress toward responsive block options over the last few years. I am not entirely unhappy with it because I want the team to be methodical and approach this in a future-proof way, at least to the extent that it can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far too often, what we have seen with requests and even third-party plugins is the use of viewport-based media queries for controlling how blocks respond to different devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, and mobile). While such controls can sometimes be the right tool for the job, they are not always the correct path for component-based design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Media queries tend to favor holistic design methodologies. However, component-based design is the modern face of the web. Blocks are just another component, and because developers or even users can place them anywhere in the overall design, we must approach how they respond to their surroundings more so than the browser viewport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The block model is a good case to apply some intrinsic design principles, since a block can occupy a place in many different layouts and containers, for which prescriptive media queries that don&rsquo;t take context into account are inflexible,&rdquo; wrote Ventura.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple example to look at is the core WordPress Columns block. We could easily add media query options for when each inner Column block breaks. <em>However, how should the typography respond for three columns vs. four and at different widths?</em> That is a function of the container&rsquo;s size rather than the viewport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And, how do such media queries work when Columns are nested within another Column?</em> This becomes a more complex problem to solve if you are putting layout controls into the hands of users. Pushing the fast-forward button on responsive block options might feel good at the moment, but it could also create legacy baggage that will be hard to drop when a better solution rolls around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even something as seemingly simple as a basic website header can become complex when designing for user input. For theme designers, there is no way to know how many characters are in the site title, for example, or how many items are in the nav menu. The block system can complicate that further by allowing end-users to drop in other unknowns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Each block area should be intrinsically responsive allowing blocks to compose together, wrap, stack, and organize themselves to fit the different spaces and screens,&rdquo; wrote Ventura. &ldquo;For this to work well, container blocks need to absorb more layout controls.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also mentioned <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries\">container queries</a> as a possible expansion point when they are fully supported by browsers in the future. Chrome Canary currently has a support flag to enable the feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Container queries are a bit of a Holy Grail for designers. As web designer Ethan Marcotte <a href=\"https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/on-container-queries/\">wrote four years ago:</a></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll start here: in the last few years, my design work has focused much more on patterns, and less on &ldquo;pages.&rdquo; Instead of treating a responsive design as a holistic, unified thing, where every part of the layout changes and adapts at the same rate, it&rsquo;s more helpful to break a responsive layout down into smaller, reusable bits of design, including things like &ldquo;masthead,&rdquo; &ldquo;footer,&rdquo; &ldquo;image caption,&rdquo; and so on.</p><p>In other words, my design process involves looking at a responsive design as a network of small layout systems. Each of those components are basically little responsive designs themselves, with their own sets of breakpoints.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sound familiar?</em> Yes, the WordPress block system is built on that same foundation of small layout components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything that WordPress does today at the UI level needs to account for the container queries of the future. Or, at least make use of existing tools that could replicate the feature in some ways, such as the <code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, and <code>clamp()</code> CSS functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trouble is figuring out which features should be exposed as block options vs. being handled under the hood. The development team must strike a balance between the user experience and flexibility for designers. Some things should &ldquo;just work&rdquo; out of the box, and others should be configurable on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This should be one of the more interesting, complex, frustrating, and rewarding problems to solve in the WordPress 5.9 cycle.

In the first half of 2021, WPScan has recorded 602 new vulnerabilities, quickly surpassing the 514 reported during all of 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report is based on attack data from Wordfence&rsquo;s platform and data from WPScan&rsquo;s vulnerability database, providing a more comprehensive picture of the current state of WordPress security than either company could present alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the trends highlighted in the report is the increase in password attacks. Wordfence blocked more than 86 billion password attack attempts in the first half of 2021. Attackers use a variety of methods to gain access to WordPress sites, including testing sites against lists of compromised passwords, dictionary attacks, and more resource intensive brute force attacks. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Source: <a href=\"https://wpscan.com/2021-Mid-Year-WordPress-Security-Report.pdf\">2021 Mid-Year WordPress Security Report</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence found the standard login to be the primary password attack target for 40.4% of attempts, followed by XML-RPC (37.7%). Since these attacks seem to be increasing, the report recommends that site owners use 2-factor authentication on all available accounts, use strong secure passwords unique to each account, disable XML-RPC when not in use, and put brute force protection in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data from Wordfence&rsquo;s Web Application Firewall shows more than 4 billion blocked requests due to vulnerability exploits and blocked IP addresses. The report includes a breakdown of the percentage of requests blocked by firewall per firewall rule. Directory Traversal accounts for 27.1% of requests. This is when an attacker attempts to access files without being authorized and perform an action such as reading or deleting a site&rsquo;s /wp-config.php file, for example. This breakdown also highlights the fact that certain older vulnerabilities are still frequently targeted by attackers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Source: <a href=\"https://wpscan.com/2021-Mid-Year-WordPress-Security-Report.pdf\">2021 Mid-Year WordPress Security Report</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The vast majority of the vulnerabilities you hear about in the WordPress ecosystem come from plugins, with themes making up a much smaller portion. The report notes that only three of the 602 vulnerabilities catalogued by WPScan in the first half of this year were found within WordPress core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In analyzing vulnerabilities by type, WPScan found that Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities accounted for more than half of all them (52%), followed by Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) at 16%, SQL Injection (13%), Access Control issues (12%), and File Upload issues (7%). Using scores from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), WPScan found that 17% of reported vulnerabilities were critical, 31% high, and 50% medium in severity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Wordfence and WPScan claim that the greater number of vulnerabilities reported this year is indicative of the growth of the WordPress ecosystem and a maturing, healthy interest in security. Themes and plugins aren&rsquo;t getting more insecure over time but rather there are more people interested in discovering and reporting vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;First and foremost, we aren&rsquo;t seeing a lot of newly introduced vulnerabilities in plugins and themes but rather we are seeing a lot of older vulnerabilities in older plugins and themes being reported/fixed that just weren&rsquo;t detected until now,&rdquo; Wordfence Threat Analyst Chloe Chamberland said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Vulnerabilities aren&rsquo;t being introduced as frequently and more vulnerabilities are being detected simply due to the higher activity of researchers which is in turn positively impacting the security of the WordPress ecosystem. Considering it isn&rsquo;t newly introduced vulnerabilities that are being frequently discovered, I feel confident in saying that the increase in discoveries doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the ecosystem is getting less secure at all but rather getting more secure.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chamberland also said she believes there is a domino effect when vulnerabilities are disclosed to vendors and they learn from their accidents, causing them to develop more secure products in the future. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Speaking from experience as I spend a lot of my time looking for vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins, things have definitely been getting more secure from my perspective,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Today, I frequently find capability checks and nonce checks in all the right places along with proper file upload validation measures in place, and all the good stuff. It&rsquo;s become harder to find easily exploitable vulnerabilities in plugins and themes that are being actively maintained which is a great thing!&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mid-year report is available as a PDF to <a href=\"https://wpscan.com/2021-Mid-Year-WordPress-Security-Report.pdf\">download</a> for free from the WPScan website. WPScan founder and CEO Ryan Dewhurst said he expects there will be an end of the year report for 2021. He has not yet discussed it with Wordfence but the companies are brainstorming about other ways they can collaborate.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 04:14:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 20) — Yoast Acquired, Businesses Need To Allow More Play\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=85143\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://poststatus.com/excerpt/20/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4363:\"<h2 id=\"h-allowing-time-to-goof-off-or-pursuing-a-passion-improves-team-connections\">Allowing time to goof off or pursuing a passion improves team connections.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><a href=\"http://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/people/jane-dutton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Professor Jane Dutton</a> from the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business suggests &#8220;four ways to build high-quality workplace connections&#8221; — respectful engagement, support, trust — and <em>play</em>.

Yoast and its SEO-related business are expected to continue operating as usual with its current team and maintaining its product line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Newfold Digital is a global web solutions provider that serves small-to-medium businesses. The <a href=\"https://newfold.com/brands\">company has many brands</a> under its umbrella, such as Network Solutions, Bluehost, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yoast never had any funding before, it grew organically into a company with 140 employees maintaining a plugin with over 12 million active installs,&rdquo; wrote van de Rakt in the announcement. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to stop there! We&rsquo;re planning to grow and improve even further! Joining Newfold Digital provides us with the freedom to build and iterate on ideas to further our mission.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no plans to change the team or the culture around Yoast. One of the goals during the acquisition was to keep everyone in place, continuing work on their product line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Of course, some things change,&rdquo; said Yoast founder and CPO Joost de Valk. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll integrate into their systems (HR and finance). We&rsquo;ll work on special offers for customers from Newfold. Our company changed so much over the five years, so it will change no matter what. I do feel that this opens up more security for growth and for developing new ideas.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Yoast does not plan to change its 140-person team, it is still bringing in fresh talent. The company has been hiring a lot lately and expects that trend to continue with <a href=\"https://yoast.com/jobs/\">19 current job openings</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As host Nathan Wrigley and guest Cory Miller discussed on the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/6-cory-miller-on-the-wordpress-mergers-and-acquisitions-landscape\">latest episode of the Jukebox</a>, acquisitions can be a welcome change for all parties. It can provide more financial stability and backing for the acquired company. It may allow the team to explore new features or new products that were not possible before. This can also work in the user&rsquo;s favor in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Marieke and I felt ever since this Covid pandemic hit that we needed a partner or some more financial backing,&rdquo; said Joost de Valk. &ldquo;Being totally bootstrapped was getting to us. We worried about the exchange rate of the dollar, for instance. We got risk-averse, and all around us other companies got financial injections.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The husband-and-wife duo thought about selling part of their stock for additional funding but was worried about potential consequences. One such downside may have been the need to grow fast to keep investors happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We wanted to find a place to keep Yoast SEO growing and to keep working on WordPress,&rdquo; said de Valk. &ldquo;We had help from RBC, a company that helps with these types of acquisitions. They introduced us to Newfold, and we had a really good connection right from the start.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He remained tight-lipped about any new products or features in the pipeline, only saying that a lot is coming and things will speed up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Newfold is the owner of several high-profile hosting brands, including Bluehost and HostGator &mdash; both offer a managed WordPress service. It would not be unheard of to see a company mix and match its various products to draw in more customers. Nor would it be surprising to eventually see Yoast SEO or even some of the commercial Yoast offerings as part of packaged hosting deals. WP Engine fully integrates StudioPress products, for example, into its packages. However, de Valk said they have yet to discuss anything on that front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right that the things you&rsquo;re proposing here make perfect sense,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So, I think we&rsquo;ll work on those deals and, at the same time, team Yoast will work independently on their products.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 20:25:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: FSE Outreach Round #9: Building a Higher Ed Header\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121395\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:161:\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-9-building-a-higher-ed-header?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fse-outreach-round-9-building-a-higher-ed-header\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6238:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It feels like it has been ages since the WordPress community has had a call for testing Full Site Editing (FSE) features. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/full-site-editing-outreach-experiment/\">FSE Outreach Program</a> was on a small hiatus. However, the WordPress 5.8 launch was also underway last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program is an open call for testing various components of FSE. Thus far, volunteers have successfully provided feedback on features that have already landed in core WordPress, such as block-based widgets and template editing. Testers have delved into others that have yet to be released. Each testing round is open to anyone who can spare a little of their free time and share their findings. The goal is to break things and point out problematic areas of the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/08/11/fse-program-testing-call-9-handling-highered-headers/\">FSE Outreach #9</a> is a community-driven suggestion that calls for building a Higher Ed site&rsquo;s header. Volunteers are asked to follow a 26-step process using the site editor beta feature in the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin and the TT1 Blocks theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a fan of this take on testing, and program lead Anne McCarthy seems to favor doing more of it in the future. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d like to suggest an idea for a call for testing, know it&rsquo;s very welcomed and all ideas will be weighed against current project priorities to figure out what makes the most sense to pursue,&rdquo; she wrote in the announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the project was all about Higher Ed, I decided to pay homage to my alma mater and use the colors that I wore proudly around campus for five years &mdash; and still do to this day. The following screenshot is the end result:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Before going forward, I must admit that I cheated to get that final look. The call for testing asked that we build from the TT1 Blocks theme. I was able to get <em>close</em> to that result, but I had to switch to a custom theme I have been working on to get past a few hurdles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I went through each stage of testing with TT1 Blocks and will cover the issues I encountered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building a Higher Ed Header</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Just getting off the ground, I ran into my first issue, which turned out to be a non-issue. The internet gods decided to play a trick on me, disallowing me from editing both the Site Title and Site Description blocks. I <em>really</em> wanted my fictional university to be &ldquo;Gutenberg University,&rdquo; but I could not do so without saving my progress and refreshing the browser tab. I was unable to replicate the issue, so I am hoping it was simply a fluke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the Navigation block still seems the most troublesome area of site editing. I know how much work the development team has put behind the user experience for this feature but cannot help but wonder if there is a point where users can opt into managing its content (the links) via the traditional Nav Menus screen in WordPress. The site editor works fine for the design aspect, but I have yet to feel comfortable using it to manage links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage of testing calls for adding multiple page links as both top-level and sub-menu items. When clicking the <code>+</code> button to add a link, my first instinct is to search for the page itself. However, the available field is a block search rather than a page search.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Accidentally searching for link in block search field.\n\n\n\n<p>To add an actual link, users must first add the Page Link block. Then, they can search for a specific page. This two-step process gets me every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran into the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33021\">issue for nav menus</a> mentioned in the call for testing where there is no space between items when used inside a Columns block. It pains the purist in me to admit it, but I had to use the Spacer block between each item to fix this. I did not need to do this with my custom theme because, I am guessing, I addressed this somewhere along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;space between items&rdquo; option also failed to work with the Navigation block, ruining one of the early design ideas I had. I decided to go in a different direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using right-alignment with the Search block did not work. Therefore, I used the 100% width option to align it with my right-aligned nav menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time and time again, I needed to rely on the Spacer block to make adjustments. Part of this was because default margins and paddings are inconsistent among different blocks. The still-missing margin controls on nearly every block also played a hand in this. This is not particularly noteworthy. The development team is aware of and working on extending spacing controls &mdash; they just can&rsquo;t get here fast enough for some of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A spacing issue is what led me to ditch TT1 Blocks and switch to a custom theme. The following screenshot is my final work with the former. You may notice the gaping green background between the nav menu group and the header image below it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />TT1 Blocks theme version with gap in header.\n\n\n\n<p>No amount of tricks or rearrangement of blocks seemed to remove that space, and I simply could not live with that. I had already solved about 90% of Gutenberg&rsquo;s spacing issues with my own theme and did not feel like writing any new CSS to address this. Making the switch also meant that I could get rid of several Spacer blocks I had in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from dropping in a header image, one other modification I made was skipping the addition of a Button block for the latest &ldquo;Covid update.&rdquo; I could not bear looking at TT1 Blocks&rsquo; overuse of padding. Instead, I nested a paragraph with a link within a column alongside a Navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I enjoyed the process. This post is meant to be critical of specific areas in the hopes that it helps build a better WordPress. For all its faults, many other parts offer a solid user experience. Overall, the Gutenberg development team continues to impress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 03:38:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Google Site Kit Plugin Ships Hot Fix for Critical Error That Caused Broken Websites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=121388\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:231:\"https://wptavern.com/google-site-kit-plugin-ships-hot-fix-for-critical-error-that-caused-broken-websites?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=google-site-kit-plugin-ships-hot-fix-for-critical-error-that-caused-broken-websites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2688:\"<p>Google published an update to its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-site-kit/\">Site Kit plugin for WordPress</a> this afternoon with a hot fix for a critical issue affecting an unknown number of users. Reports of broken websites were popping up <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thebclang/status/1425450256905510914\">on Twitter</a> and in the plugin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/error-there-has-been-a-critical-error-on-this-website-3/\">support forum</a> on WordPress.org. Users affected by the issue reported having a critical error on all sites using Site Kit, which forced deactivation of the plugin in recovery mode. In some cases it prevented them from accessing their dashboards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;On Wednesday, August 11, we identified a fatal error in the Site Kit plugin that could be triggered by other plugins or themes using an unprefixed version of Composer,&rdquo; Google Site Kit Support Lead Bethany Chobanian Lang said in a pinned <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/critical-error-issue-update-to-v1-38-1/\">post</a> on the support forum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 1.38.1 contains a hot fix for this issue, since it was critical enough to take down users&rsquo; websites. The plugin&rsquo;s maintainers began <a href=\"https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/issues/3830\">investigating the issue</a> less than 24 hours ago but are still not sure which plugins&nbsp;trigger the error due to their usage of Composer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The reports do not include which specific plugins or themes were causing this, but the error message clearly highlighted the code in Site Kit that was the problem,&rdquo; Google Developer Relations Engineer Felix Arntz said. &ldquo;Technically, that problematic code had been in Site Kit since several versions ago (months back), so maybe another plugin/theme recently got updated with new code that exposed the problem.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After looking at popular plugins, Arntz said he hasn&rsquo;t been able to find one so far that would have triggered the problem. Given Site Kit&rsquo;s broad usage, other affected sites are bound to turn up once users realize there is a problem. Google launched the plugin in 2019 and has since amassed more than a million active installations. The majority of the plugin&rsquo;s user base is running older versions, which may or may not be affected by the current issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org shows 35.6% of the plugin&rsquo;s users are on version 1.38.x. The hot fix is not backported for older releases, but users running Site Kit version 1.38 with background updates enabled should automatically receive the fix. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 02:34:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: #6 – Cory Miller on the WordPress Mergers and Acquisitions Landscape\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=120673\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:203:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/6-cory-miller-on-the-wordpress-mergers-and-acquisitions-landscape?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=6-cory-miller-on-the-wordpress-mergers-and-acquisitions-landscape\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65517:\"<h2>About this episode.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Cory Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory is likely well known to many of you, he&rsquo;s been a big part of the WordPress community for many years.

Good to see your face. And I know this is a podcast, but also hear your voice again.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:03:51]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I don&rsquo;t think Cory that we need to introduce you in all honesty, I think you are one of those people that goes with no introduction, but nevertheless, just in case there is a handful of people out there who&rsquo;ve not heard of you before or come across you. Would you just take a moment to explain a little bit about your journey with WordPress and how come we&rsquo;re chatting to you on a WordPress podcast?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:04:11]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah. So my original start with WordPress started in 2006 as a blogger. In 2008, I started a company called iThemes. Ran that for 10 plus years, we did backups security and maintenance for WordPress websites, in addition to in the early days themes, thus the name iThemes. And then in 2018, we were acquired by Liquid Web. 2019 I started on my next chapter in my journey. Currently, I am the&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what my title is, but Post Status dot com is now I&rsquo;m full owner of it. Brian Krogsgard, the founder, and I partnered up and then he is onto awesome stuff in the crypto software space. And I&rsquo;m now the community lead, I guess, for Post Status, a awesome community of WordPress entrepreneurs and professionals.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:04:59]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>There&rsquo;s an awful lot to unpack there, but regrettably, we don&rsquo;t have time to go through the history too much. But what was highlighted there is that you have been through the very thing that we&rsquo;re going to be talking about because we&rsquo;ve got Cory on the call today to talk about mergers and acquisitions and whether this is potentially for the good or for the bad, whether there&rsquo;s upsides or downsides. And let&rsquo;s go back to your journey. I&rsquo;m sure that things are different now, that is to say, I think things have hotted up since you sold iThemes, probably there&rsquo;s a lot more paperwork going involved and a lot more scrutiny on how things are transferred and so on. But just wondering if you could tell us, what was your journey like, how did you come to sell iThemes? What were the reasons behind it? And what were the options available to you at the time that you sold iThemes? Were there people clamoring at that time, or was it very much we don&rsquo;t know, people don&rsquo;t sell things in the WordPress space. How did it all work out?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:05:47]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>There had been a couple of acquisitions in the WordPress space, for sure, and I shouldn&rsquo;t say a couple, numerous acquisitions in the space, but it wasn&rsquo;t like the last year. Last year, the space has been on a tear with mergers and acquisitions, but there had been acquisitions before, in fact, at Post Status, we&rsquo;re working on a page to document all that, the acquisitions that happened in WordPress.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So in 2016 or so I started to think, what does the future look like? It feels like one day somebody at all the hosting companies goes, I wonder how much this thing called WordPress, what kind of footprint is it in our customer base, in our stack and somebody came back and probably said 40%, 50% or something like that, I&rsquo;m sure way back in the day. And it seemingly overnight a bunch of money and attention from particularly the hosting space turned to WordPress and rightfully so, I mean WordPress is a huge CMS and its footprint on the web is enormous. So around that time, I&rsquo;m seeing all these players kind of come in and, big money, start to come in, and we&rsquo;re talking about billion dollar companies or billion dollar valuation companies or companies with private equity in the billions coming into the space and really turning their attention, and I thought, my job as the leader is to fast forward the movie and see where we&rsquo;re going and make sure, you mentioned in our pre-talk about Monopoly, the game Monopoly, and I thought, wow, we are definitely the David versus Goliath now. We&rsquo;ve been bootstrapped from the beginning from 2008 on, and what does the future look like, and our toolset, the software we&rsquo;re offering at the time, it was very utility, backup security, and maintenance. GoDaddy had bought Sucuri, ManageWP. Automattic was already kind of our competition from the beginning anyway, with Jetpack and at one point their backup service VaultPress. And so Jetpack is another behemoth out there. And, I just go, I think it&rsquo;s time for us to figure this out, what&rsquo;s the next step in a big way, and really that ultimately came down to being acquired. We had a partner in Liquid Web. So they were obviously the first people that had been partnered with him for like a year and really appreciated their leadership team. Eventually my friend, Chris Lema joined them and then my friend AJ Morris was the one that put us on the map for Liquid Web. And they were doing some, wanting to really do some big things and WordPress and long story short that just all worked out. But for us, it was like, at what point do you just need to pull up your stakes and tents and move on and see what you can get? And two reasons, one is financial, of course, but the other is my team. You know, we had about 25 people at that time and I want to make sure our team has a place to land and a great career, and that up until that point, it was either Matt Danner and I, and we had to leave for anybody to have upward mobility really well. When we joined a Liquid Web, at the time, they were like 600 people. So there was a lot of opportunity, career opportunity to move within the company. And they were also doing some great stuff. Now, maybe early in my worries, you know, Mark from Wordfence a great founder, co-founder over there told me, he said, great book called only the paranoid survive. I spent about 10 years in paranoia, like insecurity. But it was time it&rsquo;s turned out to be everything Joe Oesterling and the C Suites team over at Liquid Web, everything they said to me, they have been to the letter of their word. I have really great respect for them. And so iThemes is under the leadership now of Matt Danner is killing it. There have been on the acquisition tear in the last year.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:09:16]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It is amazing because I think there&rsquo;s two sides to look at it. And we&rsquo;ll explore that as the podcast goes on. There are the good sides and there&rsquo;s possibly some downsides to this whole thing. And certainly from your perspective, it sounds like you had a really positive experience. You managed to hook up with a company who delivered on everything that you hoped that they would. So that&rsquo;s great. But then of course, I suppose there&rsquo;s the other side. The customer side, where there may be more concerns about, well, what does this mean for the product going forward? How is this going to affect the thing that I&rsquo;ve deployed on all my websites? Will it still be maintained? Are these people good custodians and so on? So just to unpack this a little bit. Over the last, like you said, maybe a year or something, we seem to have a real landslide of things happening. There&rsquo;s lots and lots of things, to the point where really a week doesn&rsquo;t go by where there is some merger and acquisition news.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:10:07]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Truly.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:10:07]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah. You follow this probably more closely than I do, but it&rsquo;s happening every single week. And some of them are big names, some of them are much smaller names, but there&rsquo;s a story there every week if you choose to go and find it. I&rsquo;m just wondering if you think this is inevitable. And what I mean by that is, was this always going to be the case? A rising tide carries all boats. If WordPress is getting bigger, it&rsquo;s inevitable, all the things which are supporting WordPress and are built on top of it are going to get bigger as well. Did you see this happening all over the place five, ten years ago? Or did you feel yourself to be a slight exception all those years ago?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:10:45]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>No, no, no, no, no. 10 years ago I was just living my dream as an entrepreneur growing a business. Most of the time, just holding on to the runaway stagecoach and was just loving every day and every week and every month and every year of our journey. I had a five-year commitment when I started the business, because I knew I&rsquo;ve been a career hopper since I was 16. I&rsquo;ve had a job on average about every two years. Until I started iThemes. I knew when I started iThemes, I had to have a five-year commitment minimum just to get the bird off the ground? So when five years came up, I was like, well, do I want to renew and this is about that time that I&rsquo;m talking about. And I was like, heck yeah, I want to re renew. I want to keep renewing these things. I worked with the most amazing people on earth. That were my friends and my coworkers who held my babies when they&rsquo;re born, who&rsquo;ve been in my house for dinners and fun times, and I got to meet their children, because we had a hybrid remote team. And so I just wanted to keep pushing renew, renew, renew, renew. And it was just at the point where I was like, I don&rsquo;t know what the renew button looks like now. I probably got in a little bit of a dark space in my fast forward in the movie to the end, but no 10 years ago, didn&rsquo;t understand the world of all of this M&amp;A stuff.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>But as I&rsquo;ve come to learn, this is a by-product to WordPress&rsquo; success. That&rsquo;s it. First and foremost, it&rsquo;s a by-product that people would go there&rsquo;s money here, there&rsquo;s value to capture all that kind of stuff. And this is what&rsquo;s called we&rsquo;re kind of seeing it, it&rsquo;s call it a roll-up that they say in that kind of a industry, the M&amp;A kind of field. You&rsquo;re just seeing right now, a big roll-up going on. Small players been scooped up adding features or customers or revenue and all that, but I just wanted to keep renewing until I thought, I don&rsquo;t think my chances are very strong to be able to renew, was concern for all parties involved.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:12:31]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The thing that I find curious is that I was in a forum the other day, and we were talking through this exact topic. It was a real split. Essentially the conversation was fairly polarized. It was, is this a good thing that we&rsquo;ve got all of these acquisitions? Is it a bad thing, you didn&rsquo;t really get to sit on the fence? You were either going to be one or the other and the people on the, this is a good thing side really were talking about the fact that this is what happens. This is a maturing thing. When an ecosystem, an area of business matures, this is what goes on. There is a coagulation that the people who&rsquo;ve been successful, the people that have got the money to buy things, they go out and they shore up the offering that they&rsquo;ve got. So that was the one side. This is just maturation of an industry. And then on the other side, there were the people who didn&rsquo;t see it that way. And they saw it more as it&rsquo;s just the big guys getting bigger, and there&rsquo;s concerns there because that&rsquo;s going to stifle all of the competition and we&rsquo;re terribly concerned about whether or not things that we&rsquo;ve been built with dedication and heart and by an individual are going to be consumed and they&rsquo;re going to lose their focus and they&rsquo;re going to lose their way. So it really split either way. And because of that, because it was so split, I decided that we&rsquo;d take the podcast in that direction and we&rsquo;d talk about the good bits and the bad bits. So let&rsquo;s go with the good, let&rsquo;s start with all the good things. And I actually think the good list, I was able to come up with more good things than bad things, not many more, but more, some of them really unexpected to me.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So first of all, If you want to espouse all of the things that you think are good, and then I can do my list or I can do my list, and then you can tell me whether or not you agree with it. It&rsquo;s entirely up to you.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:14:15]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Before we dive into that, I wanted to say, if you pushed me to say yes or no on it, I&rsquo;m very conflicted. Given a broad statement, I&rsquo;m very conflicted. And I started to parse out, is it good for the platform, WordPress? Is it good for the entrepreneurs in the space? Is it good for the people doing the acquisitions? That&rsquo;s a firm yes. The firm yes is for the people acquiring. This is a great thing for the people acquiring. Because of WordPress&rsquo; success the entrepreneurs that have built and help build WordPress to what it is today. I&rsquo;m talking specifically the service agencies, the freelancers, the users, the people that built products like me and my team and others out there that have really contributed to the success of 40% or whatever the footprint is to WordPress today.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>That&rsquo;s been a significant contribution by the commercial community, the Post Status type tech community, the people of WordPress. So I wanted to say that first cause I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s interesting, if you forced me to pick, I&rsquo;m really conflicted. But if I parse out some of those, I&rsquo;m like, okay, maybe I can share. It&rsquo;s still a yes here and a no there, yes here, on each audience. So all that to say, you go with your list and we can talk to you that for sure.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:15:25]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay. So this list in part came out of conversations that I was having with people who had been in the middle recently of acquisitions, and some of them were unexpected to me. I couldn&rsquo;t have worked them out myself. So imagine you&rsquo;re working in a company, a small company, much like you had at iThemes, 25 employees. Curious thing, better working conditions came out. So that is to say that the people working at the small company are now working at a big company and they were able to make use of all sorts of things that weren&rsquo;t available to them. So that might be heathcare.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:15:59]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah, I would reframe the phrase, working conditions to benefits and the worker benefits, absolutely, at least in my case. Way better PTO policies, way better health insurance. I&rsquo;m still on Liquid Web, we went on what&rsquo;s called Cobra because my wife worked there before we were acquired, by the way she&rsquo;d worked there three or four years or so. And then when she left last year to start Content Journey for her business, we continued on with Cobra. I&rsquo;ve been on Liquid Web health, probably five years, I think, five years now, I want to say. And so absolutely. And most of the other ones, yeah, they can do it at scale. So, yes.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:16:35]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. I don&rsquo;t know why the word conditions came into my list of there, but yeah. So job security. Better healthcare and&hellip; the UK, we have a different healthcare system and it doesn&rsquo;t require quite so much money up front if you know what I mean? So those kinds of things don&rsquo;t matter.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:16:50]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Ah, so jealous.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:16:52]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Well, yeah, health insurance and so on. But then, more of the nuts and the bolts. There&rsquo;s obviously more resources to throw the development of the project, because it may be the developer of a particular project. Maybe they were a solo person, or maybe they were working with a small team and they&rsquo;d reached the end game of what it was that they felt that they could achieve. That really, they were running out of runway. They&rsquo;d run out of inspiration, perhaps they were fed up with it and it gave them an opportunity to hand it on. Maybe they&rsquo;re going to carry on the journey. Maybe they&rsquo;ve been acquired as a part of the deal, but it gives them more people to talk to more ideas and more resources to update their plugin, theme or whatever it might be.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:17:32]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I would say yes, with this caveat, is the direction is no longer in the hands of the original founder, entrepreneurial team, always, there&rsquo;s new owners, they get to decide what the direction is. That&rsquo;s why you got to be really careful what you carve out in your agreements. But, it&rsquo;s a new owners. Yes, I would think for sure, like us going to Liquid Web, we had the resources of a hosting company who owned their own data centers. I want to say that again, hosting company actually owned their own data centers, which I had set foot in and go, wow, this is kind of rare in today&rsquo;s age. So that was exciting for us because we&rsquo;re like, what would happen if we could control the server hosting environment. Wow. Okay. That&rsquo;s awesome. So, yes, I think in theory and most what I&rsquo;ve seen in practice, absolutely more resources in terms of team products, money, even to fund.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:18:26]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah, I guess everything that we raise on one side probably has a flip side, but in this case, I think we can easily understand and pass the good side of that. The other thing of course is that if you bring along your product or service, just to keep it simple, let&rsquo;s say that you are a plugin developer and you brought along a plugin, then you are rolling into a bigger ecosystem of plugins. And so it becomes a more desirable thing. So from the end user&rsquo;s point of view, my point of view, if I can subscribe to one subscription service and get four or five different plugins all rolled into one. That&rsquo;s a real benefit for me. I&rsquo;m getting them from one vendor. I&rsquo;ve got one support channel, one price to pay. And I don&rsquo;t have to worry now about those three or four different plugins, which I&rsquo;m hoping will cobble together and make my website work perfectly. They&rsquo;re now being managed by the one team. And so there&rsquo;s something to be said about the fact that it&rsquo;s all getting rolled in and you might have just one subscription. I mean, obviously you tried to do that and succeeded with that at iThemes, you had a whole bunch of stuff going on, loads of different things and having them all under one subscription was a great offering. And the bigger that subscription gets in the more things that you can feed into it, the better it is.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:19:38]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah. I think the team that probably does this the best that I&rsquo;ve seen is Syed and his team over at Awesome Motive, which has brands of Optin Monster, WP Forms, Monster Analytics, all that. I don&rsquo;t know if I see a lot of cross selling going on, but I see them being able to take products and promote to an ecosystem to expand that. You&rsquo;re right, at iThemes we call it the Toolkit and it was like the treasure chest. I don&rsquo;t know if you ever get to a dentist&rsquo;s office, and there&rsquo;s this big treasure chest, like a pirate treasure chest. And after you get your teeth cleaned or whatever you did, you can go and dig through that. And that&rsquo;s the way I thought about our toolkit. If I fast forward the tape, I want to see a company within the space actually do that.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if I see that right now, one subscription to rule them all kind of thing. I get hosting. I get my plugins, maybe themes in there too, but really, hosting and plugins. I want to see a company doing that. Maybe if we get close to that is maybe Jetpack, where they bundled security and backups and maintenance. And now they&rsquo;ve got these, in their whole ecosystem. Jetpack just rolled out their own mobile app. That&rsquo;s really interesting to me where it&rsquo;s like one price, because here&rsquo;s the problem. Nathan, you&rsquo;ve seen this, you know this. Wix, Weebly and Squarespace, when I first started back in 2006 with WordPress and in 2008 with iThemes, we could gobble up all this, what I probably think of as the lowest end of the market, the ones that I just want to buy hosting for five bucks a month, they want to get a domain name and cobble their site together and do it for under a hundred bucks a year or something like that. Wix Weebly Squarespace came on the scene. I can&rsquo;t remember what it was. I want to say 2013, 14, 15, somewhere around that maybe, and started eating at that bottom level. And now as WordPress has gotten more complex and maybe the dashboard hasn&rsquo;t been updated as much as it should have been, Wix, Weebly and Squarespace come in and just provided this complete ecosystem for one price.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>They don&rsquo;t have to go over here and buy a theme or plug in and pull it in, separate recurring fees and all that stuff. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about updates because it&rsquo;s SaaS and they started eating at the bottom of that. Now that affected our theme business in a big way. And that&rsquo;s a dynamic I&rsquo;d love to see like awesome motive can pull it off. GoDaddy can, they&rsquo;ve made some huge strides with their onboarding. It is pretty dang incredible. I think WP Engine has with their Studiopress acquisition is starting to do some of this, pull it in, into their ecosystem. Liquid Web for sure. Now they&rsquo;ve rolled out Stellar WP, which is basically their brain for all their WordPress products, but I want to see it. I want to see it. I don&rsquo;t have to have 15 subscriptions, I can have one. Now somebody smarter than me, with financial engineering is going to have to do all the math and see if that plays out. But I want to see it as a user.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:22:24]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I feel that that&rsquo;s the inevitable direction of travel and we&rsquo;ll come back to that because I think possibly that has negatives as well as positives, but yeah, good point. Although the promise of one subscription is a nice one. We don&rsquo;t appear to have that.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:22:38]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You mentioned, here&rsquo;s a subset of this whole conversation is WooCommerce itself. WooCommerce is a platform in itself, even though it&rsquo;s technically a WordPress plugin and all that. But its footprint is enormous. It&rsquo;s the default defacto software e-commerce software on the planet and it&rsquo;s going to be for the foreseeable future. But if you have five ad-ons, you could probably go through the store to do that. Again, somebody had done initially when they rolled everything together, it&rsquo;s like how much you would spend on a WooCommerce store. I have any commerce operation I&rsquo;m partnered in called the vidibars dot com [?] And it&rsquo;s my first physical product and stunt months it&rsquo;s Anna&rsquo;s who runs it, CEO, but we are not going to go with WooCommerce, we&rsquo;re going to go Shopify. We were started on Big Commerce. Because I didn&rsquo;t want to handle the tech stack. I&rsquo;m not a developer. I might seem sometimes like one second at a, you know, a whole interview that I know what I&rsquo;m talking about, technically, but I wanted to relay all that over there. I didn&rsquo;t want to have to worry about separate plugins and updates and potential car crashes. I wanted SaaS for that. So we went Big Commerce, now we&rsquo;re going to move over to Shopify soon, and it&rsquo;s probably going to be cheaper than tagging those together. I think WooCommerce is fantastic, but that&rsquo;s this result of now one company can controls the ecosystem too, which it has all along, but, you start add up these separate things and it&rsquo;s quite a bit of money.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:23:58]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah. So a good example of that would be Stellar, who just recently acquired Iconic. So they&rsquo;ve obviously got the hosting side taken care of, and now they&rsquo;ve got Iconic WP, which is a suite of WordPress plugins specifically for WooCommerce. You feel that that could become an interesting rival for something like shopify in the e-commerce space because you know that those plugins are going to work. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll maintain them. They&rsquo;re going to sell it as a part of a package. Presumably the support will go with it as well. Just feels like that could become a one subscription rival. And then of course you&rsquo;ve got companies which are still independent, people like Yith and so on, who knows maybe by the time this goes out that have been bought. But for now, it remains by itself.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay. That&rsquo;s intriguing. The other thing which occurred to me is still on the good, is innovation. The ability to innovate, and grow things. Obviously, if you are a solo developer, you are probably hands down, writing code most of the time, your ability to market is going to be constrained. And I actually see this quite a lot in other things that I do. I get quite a lot of email from people who have been building their own plugin. They&rsquo;re simply asking for a bit of advice and a bit of help. And can you assist me in marketing this and you feel that the quickest way to do that would be if it was sold and then the company who have all the chops, they have a marketing department, they could do that on your behalf. So I saw that as another possible area, the ability to grow it, market it, and just push it out in front of more.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:25:29]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yes. If the leverage all, when you pull in, let&rsquo;s say in your latest example, Iconic. Pull their customer base and then be able to share that with the Liquid Web, Nexcess customer base. That&rsquo;s awesome. Fantastic. Yes, absolutely. From an innovation standpoint, I will say my commentary on it and you probably have bad where I can say good or whatever, but my thoughts are, you and I root for the little guy, the David or the Sally or whatever, we root for the entrepreneur. I think today, capitalism or entrepreneurship, the ability to go out there, make money by innovating and serving people and their problems. Now I subscribe to the mantra of purpose plus profit is awesome entrepreneurship. It&rsquo;s not just profit. Profit shows, we&rsquo;ve seen so many weak, terrible examples of people bulldozing other people to just make a buck. I don&rsquo;t believe in that kind of entrepreneurship, but the real awesome entrepreneurship when you want to innovate to serve someone&rsquo;s need better, make their life better, that kind, I bet on all day, every day, because that&rsquo;s where I think innovation comes. Not to say that innovation can&rsquo;t come from any of these companies. It can and does, and will like, for instance, in 2015, 16, maybe, people they&rsquo;d ask me, do you think someone can start a theme business in 2016, 15, 16. And I was like, no, I don&rsquo;t think so. I think the likelihood is very small that would be successful. And then you had companies like, even though they&rsquo;re, I guess technically a plugin, Beaver Builder. You had Elementor, even though those we could nuance that and say their plugins and all that stuff, they innovated in the theme space. And I was like, nope, it&rsquo;s done. But see there again, entrepreneurs will prove you wrong. They&rsquo;ll show, I&rsquo;ve got an idea, I&rsquo;ll execute on the idea and innovate for my customers. And I did look at those two companies, Elementor is gigantic. They are a platform in itself just like WooCommerce is a platform within a platform, but they&rsquo;re a platform. So I think innovation happens in the spark from entrepreneurship, but that&rsquo;s my comment there. It will happen at the bigger companies for sure.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:27:42]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Maybe it starts with the smaller companies, that seems to be my experience, certainly over the last 10 years, is that the real fascinating innovation is happening on the solopreneur side or the small team side. And then I wonder maybe it gets stifled a bit, but certainly from a marketing point, you&rsquo;ve got the opportunity to spread your message wider. That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:28:03]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>This comes back to our discussion. Overall, our theme is M&amp;A, and let&rsquo;s take a company like Apple. Huge. I mean, insanely profitable on that. The one I think about a lot is Shazam. It started out as an app on the platform where you could hear something, push the button and like me, this is how I learned, finding music is like, I would Shazam it and it would tell me what the song was and then I&rsquo;d go buy it from iTunes.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Well, Apple at some point goes. Wow, this app is big, they have technology we want. I don&rsquo;t know if Apple actually acquired them or how. I think they eventually did. And I don&rsquo;t know what the details were, but think about that big company like Apple known for innovation takes a smaller startup, pulls it up into their platform. That&rsquo;s a great example of how M&amp;A can work, where the smaller people, the innovation labs known as entrepreneurs in my mind get snapped up by the bigger one, that&rsquo;s harder sometimes to innovate on a large scale like that and pulled in and done that. parts of iThemes we&rsquo;re a strategic acquisition for Liquid Web in that we had iThemes Sync, which does software updates, theme plugins for wordPress websites from one dashboard. They wanted to do that in their product. Cool. Now they got to do that with that product. So connecting that back, you see how there&rsquo;s an natural progression of flow, where an industry like a WordPress starts, at least entrepreneurs innovating, putting products out, making money, and then big money comes in and goes or big companies, whatever, and I was like, wow, let&rsquo;s see what we can do. And they start to pull these pieces in. Like Iconic WP. That is a great product set. I know James, he&rsquo;s a member of Post Status, talk to James. I love his products. That&rsquo;ll be a great add on to whatever WooCommerce hosting that Nexcess &ndash; Liquid Web has, you know, to accelerate, I guess, is the word, accelerate their technology.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:29:50]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The big companies, which as you say are often hosting companies, they get to fill in the gaps as well with their offering. You just described Shazam, it&rsquo;s a perfect way of Apple making more money because you discover it and you go and buy something off iTunes. Nearly said iThemes then. And so it just fills in the gaps. You can acquire things where you feel that you want to be going in this direction as a bigger company, but you don&rsquo;t have that technology, build it yourself, or just buy it out from somebody who&rsquo;s already built and on 90% of the hard work that you need.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The other option of course, is just from the point of view of the developer, they might want to just move away. They may just wish to have a slightly different life. They want to stop what it is that they&rsquo;re doing and having a bulk injection of cash very quickly and suddenly being able to take a breather and reevaluate what it is that they want to do with their lives. I know that&rsquo;s a bit of a peculiar one, but I&rsquo;m sure, maybe there was a bit of that with what you were doing at iThemes.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:30:40]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You mentioned that in our pre-talk with Elliot Condon, from Advanced Custom Fields, that&rsquo;s the stories. I don&rsquo;t know him personally, but everything I&rsquo;ve heard and saw written about it was he wanted his startup baby to go to a good company. And it did with Delicious Brains, and Brad Touesnard over there is fantastic, and this whole team. But Elliot was ready for a next chapter and whatever that is, he was ready for the next chapter. When I was going through mine, I will not say Nathan, consciously, it was like, I&rsquo;m ready for my next chapter. I was really in, oh, wow, we got to figure this out. I got to transition our team, make sure they&rsquo;re taken care of. I want to pull value out of the business, that&rsquo;s my 401k. That&rsquo;s my nest egg, was the business. And so all those things needed to happen, but I&rsquo;ll tell you now what, three years after it, I needed a kick in the butt for my next chapter, I would have kept pressing renew and what had happened to me and here&rsquo;s the downside for entrepreneurs is I put, at some point you experienced some success and you&rsquo;re like, oh gosh, this was tough. Maybe I just want to sit back and enjoy the ride for a little bit. But what happened was I put my career, my skills on autopilot and didn&rsquo;t really grow some key skills, cause I didn&rsquo;t have to. What the acquisition did, and when I left was actually put me in the box of like no other torch, you got to. I didn&rsquo;t get live on a beach forever money. And I didn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t want to live on a beach forever. I want to work. I want to do things that makes people&rsquo;s lives better. And in this thing we call video game, we call it entrepreneurship, but I&rsquo;ll tell you, in retrospect, looking back, I needed that, even though I hated, I still miss my team, I still miss my friends. I still get to talk to some of them, but I&rsquo;m like, I miss those people. They were incredible people. They still are. That was the biggest pain of that. The other probably secondary was identity, and, what am I going to do next? I didn&rsquo;t have a plan B. I put all my eggs in one basket.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:32:38]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s just a great option though, isn&rsquo;t it? You mentioned Elliot in that particular case, if those were the thoughts going through his head, he could either just walk away from it, and let the product stagnate, or he can move it along to somebody that he, in his case, like you said, Delicious Brains, trust them feels that that&rsquo;s a perfect place for it to go. He&rsquo;s happy. It&rsquo;s going to have a good future. Millions of people are using it and they continue to be happy, but also he gets to do what he wants, which is to take a bit of time out and have a bit of a change of lifestyle, which is really nice.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay. That&rsquo;s my list of goods. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve got any that you feel we missed, but we&rsquo;ll move on to the bads if you don&rsquo;t.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:33:16]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>No, let&rsquo;s go.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:33:17]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay. Let&rsquo;s do the bads. One of the things which I fear in all of this is the stifling of competition from it. So you get to the point where a particular product has so much reach. It&rsquo;s got so much marketing clout, they&rsquo;ve got all the money to spend on the advertising of it, and it just becomes&hellip; there is no competition. The other thing which I&rsquo;ve seen happen, I won&rsquo;t mention any names, but people who have the money simply buying out the competition and then just letting it go to waste. They literally take out the competition with money so that their own product is the last man standing for want of a better word. So I don&rsquo;t know if you have any thoughts on that, but that was one negative.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:33:58]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Your competition is a very valid point because what happens when there&rsquo;s only four players, right? Which, it may be like four players in a couple of years, four or five, maybe, I don&rsquo;t know. And that&rsquo;s a very fair point that you see these entrepreneurial companies like us. We&rsquo;re scrappy. Every day, we felt like we had to wake up and earn our right to continue to serve our customers because we&rsquo;re not hugely funded and got all the steam in the world to own it. We were ultimately building on another platform and actually two platforms, WordPress and hosting. Whatever the hosting company they were with.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So I think that&rsquo;s a very fair point, like competition, where you kind of seen that within the managed WordPress hosting industry, look at all the different players. And I won&rsquo;t say about names cause you know them all, but go and just research and look at the prices and the feature sets. They&rsquo;re pretty similar. I know because about six months, eight months ago, I was looking for managed WordPress hosting. I was dismayed. So you see that where I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s collusion or anything, but you go, well, there&rsquo;s just this many competitors. They&rsquo;re going to all look at each other and see how they can co-exist and outmaneuver each other.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>But I fundamentally believe even though I hated us as an entrepreneur, Nathan, I&rsquo;m never going to tell you otherwise I hate competition as entrepreneur, but it is absolutely essential, for entrepreneurs for our customers because without competition, you&rsquo;re absolutely right. So they&rsquo;re going to be in a monopoly and then you can force any changes out that you want.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>A great example of this is Google. They are dominant. And from the beginning I&rsquo;ve been saying like a broken record, their thing was don&rsquo;t be evil. Well, I want to have a sign up that says Google&hellip; remember&hellip; don&rsquo;t be evil. Remember this are you straying against this, but that&rsquo;s the pressure we put within the environment because all those publicly held companies have stockholders to satisfy that stock price, they manage religiously because it&rsquo;s part of their job security. And unfortunately, this is a system we&rsquo;ve created is that they&rsquo;ll keep pushing down and ultimately become about money. It&rsquo;s a big cycle that I&rsquo;ve seen that I just baffle at. Down here at the bottom, you got people that have 401ks., Like I had at Liquid Web and my team had it and iThemes and all that. Right. And that gets invested into the stock market and you want it to grow. You expect it and demand it to grow. Well, on the other side of this equation are the people that are at these big companies that you&rsquo;ve invested your nest egg into you. And what&rsquo;s the message out? Go increase value, make sure it&rsquo;s whatever percentage, year over year, quarter over quarter, all that stuff.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And it&rsquo;s a vicious cycle where then they push it back down to the same people contributing to the 401k to say more money, more money. We got to have this money. It&rsquo;s a crappy viscious cycle. Back to your competition thing. That&rsquo;s part of it. I think competition is good for the space and ultimately for the user, particularly the WordPress user, you got my diatribe here.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:37:10]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>No, no, that&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to hear it. I guess the flip side of that might be the country argument may be that in a vacuum where the competition has been basically bought up, possibly stifled. The vacuum creates the opportunity for the next round of people who suddenly want to fill up that vacuum with their own plugin, keep saying plugin, it could be anything, but we&rsquo;ll go with plugin.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So, okay. All of the decent things, decent plugins in the WordPress space have been acquired by these large companies. Now there&rsquo;s space, now I can come in and pivot and of course the question is, whether you&rsquo;ve got the nouse to compete against the giant marketing budgets, but yeah, Google was a great example. It became something gigantic. It became the incumbent. And at some point there&rsquo;s no choice left. If you want to have a decent search, they seem to be the way to go.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay. What about this one? The fear that licensing or terms and conditions that you signed up to, maybe changed. So a plugin is acquired by another company. You&rsquo;ve got it as a WordPress website builder or developer, you&rsquo;ve got it on 50 sites spread around the internet and it works, and you read through the terms and conditions. You know what you&rsquo;re expecting, you know, what your license fee is, you know, the tier that you&rsquo;re on that fear that whoa, hang on. This is all going to change. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen now. All of my websites are in jeopardy. That&rsquo;s a thing.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-corymiller vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Cory Miller</cite> [00:38:32]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;ve seen it happen. You&rsquo;ve seen it happen, Nathan. And I&rsquo;ll tell you. My values are and do right. Do good. And then you do well. If you do right and good in the world, right? And well in the world, or good in the world, you should do well. If you serve people and help them make their lives better, you should do well.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You should be handsomely rewarded for that. But sadly, I&rsquo;ve seen companies that kind of went back on their word or whatever had been initially agreed. And I would challenge my colleagues and my friends in the space not to do that. Do right. Do good by people, which means honoring your word. And if you did a lifetime deal or you did something like that, you got to honor that because I&rsquo;ll tell you, I think in the future, Nathan, there&rsquo;s going to be a swell of, in the United States back in the early part of 20th century we had unions. They came about because they were needed because workplace conditions were terrible, particularly in manufacturing and these unions sprung up. Now, today, we see some of those professional unions going down, but I think in the future, there&rsquo;s going to be consumer unions. And you talk about one that&rsquo;s like right, for a consumer union, it&rsquo;s called WordPress, the WordPress community, because all the people around there can band together and say, we won&rsquo;t accept what you&rsquo;ve done.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think that&rsquo;s going to have to be the way, we the people are going to have to band together and say, no, that&rsquo;s not right, Google, don&rsquo;t be evil. Facebook, don&rsquo;t be evil. We&rsquo;re going to have to band together and put our force. And that&rsquo;s the only way. And the way you do it, as you hit their hot pocket book, we felt like every customer came in with a dollar voted for our business. And if they stop paying, they voted our business out, out of office or whatever you want to call it. And we can do that, Sally is going to have to happen in the future is because there&rsquo;s going to control so much of the space. So much of the key parts of the board that consumers are going to have to band together and say, no entrepreneurs are going to have to rise upand say, here&rsquo;s my innovative solution. Thankfully, we have a little bit of the GPL to cover us maybe downstream. That is one. I&rsquo;ll give it to Matt Mullenweg, he&rsquo;s been the champion of the GPL from the beginning. Keeping products that aren&rsquo;t SaaS, particularly in the WordPress repo, GPL. And I applaud him for that. I haven&rsquo;t always agreed with him, but I&rsquo;ve respected them. And that&rsquo;s one that I think will help ultimately the WordPress user in the future.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:40:54]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Good point. That&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;ve got down, neither in the good, nor the bad side, is that depending on how it goes, somebody with the right skills can just fork, whatever it is that they feel aggrieved about. But it does concern me that the terms and conditions change, we had a really good example of that not so long ago where there was confusion, it would appear. I think it was a tweet or an email or something led people to believe that the licensing terms were going to be changed. And then the social media storm happened. That seems to be the way at the moment to get everybody&rsquo;s voices out and say, we don&rsquo;t want this to happen, please honor what was the case, and in this particular case, you&rsquo;ll probably know what I&rsquo;m talking about. The company said, oh, okay, that&rsquo;s what you want, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll give you. And it all resolved itself very quickly, but concern that those kinds of things in the future will happen. Especially if you&rsquo;ve got a plugin, which is used on millions of sites and literally as the underpinnings of your website business, that would be terribly, terribly worrying.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The other&hellip; an another concern that I&rsquo;ve got is the simple acquisition of the audience. You are buying the plugin. You have no intention to maintain it at all. You are just buying, dare I say it, you&rsquo;re buying the opportunity to put a little advert in people&rsquo;s WordPress admin area, or you are buying an email list or what have you, and I&rsquo;ve seen that happen as well. So that&rsquo;s a point of concern, not often, but I have seen it happen.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s an effect, potentially effect of all this, but that&rsquo;s back to let your voice be known. WordPress is so strong because, it&rsquo;s eclectic, it&rsquo;s so diverse in a good way, but democratize publishing is the WordPress mission. And so like that means have your voice, say your voice, share your voice. Even if I don&rsquo;t like it, I still promote it. WordPress users are going to have to wake up. And I&rsquo;m going to say it again. WordPress users have to wake up. They have to let their voice be known. They have to find the place to let their voice be known and congregate and share and rally.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Now it doesn&rsquo;t mean like a coup all the time. It means, let your voice of displeasure be known. Mostly, I love how WordPress has been built. Obviously I&rsquo;m so thankful for the thousands of contributors that have made WordPress, what it is today, selflessly over the years to build it to what it is today.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;m so thankful for that legacy and their work, but it&rsquo;s also a meritocracy where when you contribute and we listen to people. By and large, we, the community listen and let the minority voice be heard. And it&rsquo;s one of the great things about our community is you can have a voice in the community if you choose so. WordPress users have to start choosing to do so.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>That is basically my list. There&rsquo;s a few others, but that was my good / bad list. I have a question for you to round us out and it&rsquo;s a peculiar question and it&rsquo;s yes, no, you got a binary choice or I suppose you could try and sit on the fence on this one.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Given the exact same plugin from a big company or a, let&rsquo;s say solo preneur or a small company.

I think entrepreneurship as a career vocation in the world is a sacred one. It&rsquo;s a noble one. If done right. If we do the kind of equation. Do good, do right in the world, and you should do well in the world. What happens when it gets poisonous and terrible and all that is when the script gets flipped and people just say, oh no, no, the equation just profit, profit, profit.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Well, I&rsquo;m sorry if you&rsquo;re just in the profit, profit, profit, and you bulldoze people, I hope you fail.

So that&rsquo;s why he said, this is binary and I gave you all this commentary, but I root for the entrepreneur and the one that&rsquo;s doing it right, and doing good for people and serving people and taking care of their people, customers and their team. I&rsquo;ll put my money there every single time.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:45:46]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Really interesting.

I was in a forum and we were talking about this exact same thing. Somebody in that forum, I won&rsquo;t mention the name in case they didn&rsquo;t want it to be mentioned, but they compared the current marketplace for WordPress to a game of Monopoly.

I&rsquo;ll answer. I&rsquo;m going to give you a question and I&rsquo;m going to answer it. If I have a chance between a non WordPress company and a WordPress company, who am I going to buy from? And that includes Automattic. I&rsquo;m going to say WordPress every single time. I&rsquo;m going to go with a WordPress company for sure. I am a customer of all the companies we&rsquo;ve talked about. Including Automattic. I give my money to those. So WordPress company over non-WordPress company, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m biased. I&rsquo;m going to pick WordPress. Just why I live in Oklahoma.

In July 2021, contributors to the project <a href=\"https://opensearch.org/blog/updates/2021/07/opensearch-general-availability-announcement/\">announced the first general availability (GA) release of OpenSearch 1.0,</a> an Apache 2.0-licensed fork of Elasticsearch 7.10.2 and Kibana 7.10.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In what appears to be a slap back at the open source fork, Elastic has begun making its client libraries incompatible with OpenSearch. The Python client was updated to perform an API request that will <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py/pull/1623\">verify connection to Elasticsearch</a> and raise an error if it doesn&rsquo;t receive the proper response. The PR received 40 &ldquo;thumbs-down&rdquo; reactions from the community and a brief round of criticism before the discussion was shut down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disappointing to see this,&rdquo; Invenio product manager Lars Holm Nielsen said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re forcing us as bystanders in a battle to choose sides. We develop an Open Source product that could likely easily work with both Elasticsearch or OpenSearch and then the users can choose for themselves if they want Elasticsearch or OpenSearch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now, instead, we likely have to make choice for all our users if we want OpenSearch or Elasticsearch. This and other behaviors from Elastic really does not give me any confidence in Elastic and what you might do in the future. And don&rsquo;t blame it all on Amazon &ndash; you&rsquo;ve already changed the server license, you didn&rsquo;t have to make this move.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elastic Senior Engineering Manager Philip Krauss responded before turning off comments on the discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Amazon OpenSearch is a different product,&rdquo; Krauss said. &ldquo;And while there is some shared history, there are already many differences that cause real confusion and issues.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Kudos to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elastic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@elastic</a> for making us all collateral damage in its war with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awscloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@awscloud</a>.

Over the past few weeks, Elastic added&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py/pull/1623\" target=\"_blank\">new logic</a>&nbsp;to several of these clients that rejects connections to OpenSearch clusters or to clusters running open source distributions of Elasticsearch 7, even those provided by Elastic themselves. While the client libraries remain open source, they now only let applications connect to Elastic&rsquo;s commercial offerings.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenSearch published a list of a dozen clients for which contributors plan to create forks that will maintain compatibility with all Elasticsearch distributions, even those produced by Elastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We do not recommend updating to the latest version of any Elastic-maintained clients, as this may cause applications to break,&rdquo; OpenSearch maintainers urged users in the latest project update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elastic&rsquo;s decision to prevent official clients from working with open source forks has further undermined any remaining goodwill the company had after re-licensing Elasticsearch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Looks like Elastic has sucked all the benefit they could from open source and is now spitting out the bones,&rdquo; OSI Director of Standards and Policy Simon Phipps <a href=\"https://twitter.com/webmink/status/1424842761887440905\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10up, makers of the ElasticPress.io service, one of the most prominent Elasticsearch-powered products in the WordPress ecosystem, is still considering its next move after Elasticsearch abandoned its open source licensing. The company is not in any hurry to choose sides. Vasken Hauri, 10up&rsquo;s VP of Platforms and Systems, said the dispute &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t something that we&rsquo;re concerned about in the near term (the next 2-3 years).&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upgrading past Elasticsearch 7.11+ would require making a choice between continuing on with Elastic&rsquo;s proprietary offering or switching to the open source fork. Hauri said that the company is &ldquo;barely taking advantage of most of the features Elasticsearch offers now&rdquo; and projects that the current roadmap &ldquo;could probably run another couple of years without any need to get new features from Elasticsearch.&rdquo; For the time being, the 6,000+ users of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/\">ElasticPress WordPress plugin</a> and customers of the <a href=\"https://ElasticPress.io\">ElasticPress.io</a> service have nothing to worry about as a result of Elastic&rsquo;s renewed war with Amazon.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 05:46:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Tue, 07 Sep 2021 21:06:59 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 07 Sep 2021 20:45:10 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:2:\"br\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20210907210300\";}','no'),(329,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1631092020','no'),(330,'_transient_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1631048820','no'),(331,'_transient_timeout_dash_v2_88ae138922fe95674369b1cb3d215a2b','1631092020','no'),(332,'_transient_dash_v2_88ae138922fe95674369b1cb3d215a2b','<div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wordpress.org/news/2021/09/the-month-in-wordpress-august-2021/\'>The Month in WordPress: August 2021</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wordpress.org/news/2021/08/an-update-on-the-classic-editor-plugin/\'>An Update on the Classic Editor Plugin</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://gutenbergtimes.com/standardization-for-theme-json-blocks-without-build-process-patterns-weekend-edition-183/\'>Gutenberg Times: Standardization for theme.json, Blocks without Build process, Patterns – Weekend Edition #183</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/worldwide-wordpress-virtual-5k-set-for-october-1-30-2021?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=worldwide-wordpress-virtual-5k-set-for-october-1-30-2021\'>WPTavern: Worldwide WordPress Virtual 5K Set for October 1-30, 2021</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://poststatus.com/excerpt/23/\'>Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 23) — Farewell To Andrea — but not the Classic Editor</a></li></ul></div>','no'),(338,'woocommerce_downloads_redirect_fallback_allowed','no','no'),(339,'_transient_wc_attribute_taxonomies','a:0:{}','yes'),(340,'woocommerce_paypal_settings','a:23:{s:7:\"enabled\";s:2:\"no\";s:5:\"title\";s:6:\"PayPal\";s:11:\"description\";s:85:\"Pay via PayPal;
